      <h2>What is Chlamydia?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Chlamydia is a widespread bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI)
        caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It is one of the most commonly reported
        STIs in the United States, with approximately 2.86 million new cases
        annually. Chlamydia is treatable with prescription antibiotics, but
        early detection is crucial. If left untreated, it can cause severe
        reproductive health issues, including infertility.

      <h2>How is Chlamydia Transmitted?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Chlamydia is primarily spread through sexual contact, including vaginal,
        anal, and oral sex, with an infected person. It can also be transmitted
        through shared sex toys. Unlike some other bacteria, Chlamydia
        trachomatis targets soft, sensitive tissues like those found in the
        reproductive organs, rectum, throat, and eyes. It does not survive on
        skin surfaces.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, pregnant individuals can pass chlamydia to their newborn
        during childbirth, which may result in neonatal pneumonia or eye
        infections. Screening and treatment for chlamydia during pregnancy help
        prevent complications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Can You Get Chlamydia From Kissing or Toilet Seats? </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        No, chlamydia is not transmitted through kissing, hugging, or using
        toilet seats. However, oral sex with an infected person can spread the
        infection.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Who is at Risk?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who is sexually active can contract chlamydia, but some groups
        are at higher risk, including:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Young people aged 15-24:</strong> This age group accounts for
          nearly two-thirds of all chlamydia cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Women aged 14-24:</strong> Due to biological differences,
          women’s vaginal lining is more susceptible to bacterial infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Men who have sex with men (MSM):</strong> Chlamydia can be
          transmitted through oral and anal sex.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>How Often Should You Test for Chlamydia?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends regular
        screenings to identify chlamydia infections early:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Women under 25:</strong> Annual testing is recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Women over 25:</strong> Testing is advised for those with risk
          factors like multiple sexual partners or a new partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pregnant women:</strong> All pregnant women should be tested
          during their first prenatal visit, with follow-up tests for those at
          higher risk.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>How to Prevent Chlamydia</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        While abstinence is the only sure way to avoid chlamydia, there are
        effective steps to reduce the risk of infection:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Protection:</strong> Condoms and dental dams provide a
          barrier to protect against infection during vaginal, anal, and oral
          sex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be in a Monogamous Relationship:</strong> Limit sexual
          activity to one uninfected partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit Sexual Partners:</strong> The more partners you have,
          the higher your risk of infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Douching:</strong> Douching disrupts healthy vaginal
          bacteria and increases the risk of infection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>What to Do If You’re Exposed</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you or your partner(s) show symptoms or think you’ve been exposed,
        get tested before having sex again. Notify recent partners so they can
        also seek testing and treatment. If you test positive, follow the full
        course of prescribed antibiotics. It’s recommended to avoid sexual
        activity until the infection is completely cleared. The CDC suggests
        getting retested 3 months after successful treatment.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Is Chlamydia Curable?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, chlamydia is curable with antibiotics. Common treatments include{" "}
        <strong>azithromycin</strong> (a single-dose treatment) or{" "}
        <strong>doxycycline</strong> (a week-long course). Your healthcare
        provider will determine the best treatment for you. It is essential to
        complete the full course of medication, even if symptoms disappear.
