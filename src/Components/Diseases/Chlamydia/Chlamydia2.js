      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Chlamydia is a widespread bacterial sexually transmitted infection

        oral, vaginal, and anal sex. While many people show no symptoms, it can
        lead to serious reproductive health issues, including infertility, if
        left untreated. Early detection and treatment with antibiotics are
        crucial.
