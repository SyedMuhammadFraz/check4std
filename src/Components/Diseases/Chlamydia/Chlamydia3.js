      <h2>Chlamydia Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Chlamydia is a widespread bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) that is both easily treatable and preventable. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications such as infertility. The only way to confirm if you have chlamydia or another STI is by getting tested regularly. While the thought of testing might feel intimidating, it’s a normal and essential step toward safeguarding your health. Testing for chlamydia is typically quick and straightforward. If diagnosed, it can be effectively treated, allowing you to regain your health with proper medication.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Types of Chlamydia Testing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Urine Test:</strong> This involves providing a urine sample, which is analyzed for the presence of <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> bacteria. This is the primary method we use for chlamydia testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Swab Test:</strong> In cases of non-genital infections (such as from oral or anal sex), a swab of the urethra, vagina, cervix, throat, anus, or eye may be used to collect cell samples.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blood Test:</strong> Less commonly, a blood sample may be drawn to check for antibodies related to chlamydia.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Test for Chlamydia?</h2>
      <p>
        You can get tested for chlamydia and other STIs at our local, CLIA-certified testing centers. Our FDA-cleared NAA (nucleic acid amplification) urine test can detect chlamydia as early as 1-5 days after potential exposure. At the lab, you will provide a urine sample in a private room. The process is simple, allowing you to be in and out quickly. Test results are typically available within 1-2 business days and can be securely accessed through your online account.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested for Chlamydia?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Have had sexual contact with someone diagnosed with chlamydia.</li>
        <li>Engaged in unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal sex.</li>
        <li>Have new or multiple sexual partners.</li>
        <li>Are experiencing symptoms of chlamydia (though symptoms are often absent).</li>
        <li>Are pregnant.</li>
        <li>Wish to check your sexual health status.</li>
        <li>Are entering a new relationship.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>How Often Should You Get Tested?</h2>
      <p>
        If you suspect exposure to chlamydia, testing should be done as soon as possible. The CDC recommends at least annual testing for individuals at higher risk, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sexually active women under 25 years old.</li>
        <li>Women with new or multiple sexual partners.</li>
        <li>Men who have sex with men (MSM).</li>
        <li>Pregnant women, who should be tested during their first prenatal visit and, if necessary, in the third trimester.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Routine testing for chlamydia and other STIs is crucial to avoid serious health issues such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infertility.</li>
        <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women.</li>
        <li>Epididymitis, urethritis, and prostatitis in men.</li>
        <li>Reactive arthritis.</li>
        <li>Increased susceptibility to other STIs, including HIV.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What Should You Do If You Test Positive?</h2>
      <p>
        Testing positive for chlamydia can be stressful, but the good news is that it’s completely curable. Early detection prevents lasting health problems. Inform your sexual partner(s) so they can also get tested and treated. If you test positive through our services, we provide a doctor consultation over the phone. During this call, the doctor will discuss your diagnosis, prescribe appropriate medication, and send the prescription to your chosen pharmacy.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Is Chlamydia Treated?</h2>
      <p>
        Chlamydia can be treated effectively with antibiotics. Prompt treatment is vital to prevent serious complications. Make sure your sexual partner(s) are also tested and treated to avoid reinfection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Azithromycin:</strong> A single-dose oral medication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Doxycycline:</strong> Taken orally over several days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms improve. Each person must have their own prescription—medication should not be shared.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can You Get Chlamydia Again After Treatment?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, reinfection is possible if you engage in sexual activity with an infected partner after treatment. Antibiotics treat the current infection but do not provide immunity against future exposures. To reduce the risk of reinfection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use condoms or dental dams during all sexual activities.</li>
        <li>Communicate openly with your partners about their sexual health and habits.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>When Should You Retest for Chlamydia?</h2>
      <p>
        Doctors recommend waiting at least 3-6 months after treatment to get retested. Retesting too soon may result in a false positive due to residual bacterial RNA or DNA. For those with multiple partners or high-risk behaviors, testing every 3-6 months is advised.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When Can You Resume Sexual Activity?</h2>
      <p>
        Wait at least seven days after completing your antibiotic course before engaging in sexual activity. This ensures the infection is fully cleared. Resuming sexual activity too soon may lead to reinfection. When you do resume sex, use protection such as condoms or dental dams to minimize risk. Limiting the number of sexual partners or practicing mutual monogamy with a tested and negative partner also helps reduce risks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treating Chlamydia During Pregnancy</h2>
      <p>
        Pregnant individuals diagnosed with chlamydia must seek treatment to avoid complications, such as preterm delivery or transmitting the infection to the baby during childbirth. Chlamydia can lead to neonatal pneumonia or conjunctivitis. Speak with your doctor to identify safe antibiotic options for treatment during pregnancy.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Chlamydia Pills</h2>
      <p>
        Always take all the prescribed chlamydia pills, even if symptoms disappear early. Stopping treatment prematurely might leave the infection untreated, leading to complications or reinfection.
