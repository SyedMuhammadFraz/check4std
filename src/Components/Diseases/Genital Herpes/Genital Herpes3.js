      <h2>Genital Herpes Symptoms in Men</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Genital herpes can manifest with a variety of symptoms, including blisters, sores, lesions, painful ulcers, itching, and burning sensations in the genital region, anus, or upper thighs. However, about two-thirds of individuals with genital herpes either do not show any symptoms or experience very mild symptoms, which are sometimes mistaken for other skin conditions. Even if symptoms are not present, genital herpes can still be transmitted to others. Our medical professionals recommend testing for both herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) to determine your status.

      <h3>How Will I Know If I Have Genital Herpes?</h3>
      <p>
        Genital herpes often does not show clear symptoms, with two-thirds of cases being asymptomatic. The only definitive way to determine if you have genital herpes is by getting tested for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Symptoms like blisters or sores in the genital area, fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, and painful urination can all be associated with genital herpes.

      <h3>What Do Genital Herpes Outbreaks Feel or Look Like?</h3>
      <p>
        Outbreaks of genital herpes typically become less severe over time. Many people report initial prodromal symptoms (warning signs) before an outbreak. These prodromal symptoms include mild tingling or shooting pains in areas like the legs, hips, or buttocks, lasting from 2 hours to 2 days. Following these warning signs, red spots appear and develop into clear, fluid-filled blisters. The blisters burst or break, leaving painful ulcers, which generally heal within 10 days. In women, these blisters can appear inside the vagina, leading to painful urination.

      <h3>What Causes or Triggers Genital Herpes Outbreaks?</h3>
      <p>
        While the exact cause of outbreaks is not fully understood, they are often triggered by a weakened immune system, skin injuries, menstruation, fever, nerve damage, tissue damage from surgery, or exposure to extreme weather conditions. An outbreak happens when the HSV-1 or HSV-2 virus reactivates from its dormant state. Genital herpes is a lifelong infection, and once contracted, it can cause recurring outbreaks throughout life. Those experiencing their first herpes outbreak can expect to have several (usually four or five) outbreaks within the first year. Over time, these episodes generally become less frequent and less severe. The first outbreak is typically the longest and most intense, but subsequent outbreaks tend to be shorter and more manageable with antiviral treatments.
