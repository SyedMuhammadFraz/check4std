      <h2>How Will I Know If I Have Genital Herpes?</h2>
      <p>
        Genital herpes is often asymptomatic, meaning that it does not always present visible symptoms. Around two-thirds of cases are silent. The most reliable way to determine whether you have genital herpes is by getting tested for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Symptoms like blisters or sores in the genital region, fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, and painful urination could all indicate genital herpes.

      <h2>What Do Genital Herpes Outbreaks Feel or Look Like?</h2>
      <p>
        Genital herpes outbreaks tend to lessen in severity over time. Many individuals report experiencing prodromal symptoms, or early warning signs, before an outbreak. These symptoms can include mild tingling or shooting pains in areas such as the legs, hips, or buttocks, lasting anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days. After these initial signs, red spots develop into painful blisters filled with clear fluid. These blisters may burst, leaving behind painful ulcers, which typically heal within 10 days. In women, blisters may appear inside the vagina, which can cause painful urination.

      <h2>What Causes or Triggers Genital Herpes Outbreaks?</h2>
      <p>
        Although the precise cause of outbreaks is not fully understood, they are often linked to a weakened immune system, skin injuries, menstruation, fever, nerve damage, tissue damage from surgery, or exposure to extreme weather conditions. Genital herpes outbreaks occur when the HSV-1 or HSV-2 virus is reactivated from its dormant state. While genital herpes is incurable, once contracted, outbreaks may recur throughout life. Those having their first herpes episode can expect to experience several outbreaks (typically four to five) within the first year. Over time, these recurrences usually become less frequent and less severe. The first outbreak tends to be the longest and most intense, but subsequent outbreaks are often shorter and can be managed with antiviral medication.
