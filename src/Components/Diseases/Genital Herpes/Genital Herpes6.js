      <h2>Herpes Lab Testing</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Herpes is a prevalent, sexually transmitted viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is commonly recognized for causing sores on the mouth, genital areas, and nearby regions. The location of the outbreak, however, depends on the type of herpes simplex virus involved.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Types of Herpes Simplex Virus</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) is the strain of the virus that typically causes sores on or around the genital region. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause sores in similar locations, but the main difference lies in where the outbreaks occur.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h3>HSV-2 and Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        HSV-2 causes painful sores in the genital area, including on the vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, anus, scrotum, inner thighs, or buttocks. These sores can be itchy, burning, and painful. In some cases, painful urination or abnormal vaginal discharge may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first outbreak tends to be the most severe, with symptoms like fever and general malaise, in addition to the sores.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Transmission of HSV-2</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HSV-2 is primarily spread through unprotected sexual contact, including direct contact with herpes sores. It is highly contagious, especially during outbreaks when sores are present. Pregnant women with active genital herpes may need a C-section to avoid transmitting the virus to the newborn.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Testing for Herpes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HSV-2 can be detected through a blood test known as chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), which checks for antibodies your body produces in response to the herpes virus. It's recommended to wait at least a month after potential exposure before testing for the virus.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Our Herpes Simplex 2 Test</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The FDA-cleared HSV-2 test is highly accurate, with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity. This test helps in identifying whether you are currently infected with HSV-2 or have been exposed in the past.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of HSV-2 Infection</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The symptoms include painful and itchy sores in the genital area. You might also experience discomfort when urinating or an abnormal discharge. It is important to seek testing if you notice any of these symptoms, as early diagnosis can help manage the condition better.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although there is no cure for herpes, antiviral medications like Acyclovir and Valacyclovir can help reduce the severity of outbreaks and speed up the healing process. These medications can either be taken daily or as soon as an outbreak begins.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing for HSV-2 is recommended if you've had unprotected sexual contact or if you notice sores or symptoms. It's important to be aware of the possibility of HSV-2 even if no symptoms are present, as the virus can still spread.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>When to Get Tested</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's advisable to wait for antibodies to develop before testing, usually around a month or more after potential exposure to the virus.
      </p>
      
      <br />
      <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A diagnosis of HSV-2 is typically made through a blood test that detects antibodies. Once diagnosed, antiviral medications can help manage symptoms, though there's no cure for the virus.
