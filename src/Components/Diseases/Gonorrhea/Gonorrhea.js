      <h2>What is Gonorrhea?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection classified as a sexually transmitted
        disease (STD). It is highly prevalent but treatable with prescribed
        antibiotics. This infection spreads through vaginal, anal, and oral
        sexual contact. Every year, approximately 820,000 new cases of gonorrhea
        are reported in the United States alone. Many people who contract
        gonorrhea may not realize they have it due to the absence of symptoms or
        the presence of mild symptoms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Colloquially, gonorrhea is referred to as “the drip” or “the clap.” It
        is particularly common among teenagers and young adults in their 20s.
        The infection is caused by the bacterium <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>,
        which targets the mucous membranes of the reproductive system. In women,
        it can infect the cervix, fallopian tubes, and uterus, while in men, it
        affects the urethra. Gonorrhea can also infect other parts of the body,
        including the throat, anus, eyes, and (less frequently) joints. If left
        untreated, gonorrhea can cause severe health complications, including
        infertility, making routine testing essential for sexually active
        individuals.
      </p>
      <br />
      
      <h2>Symptoms of Gonorrhea</h2> <br />
      <p>
        Gonorrhea symptoms often go unnoticed, especially in women, as most
        women and some men show no signs of infection. However, when symptoms do
        appear, they can vary depending on the infected area.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Symptoms in Men:</h3> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Pain or burning sensation during urination</li>
        <li>White, yellow, or green discharge from the penis</li>
        <li>Swollen or painful testicles</li>
      </ul> <br />

      <h3>Symptoms in Women:</h3> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Pain or burning sensation while urinating</li>
        <li>Increased vaginal discharge</li>
        <li>Vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods</li>
      </ul> <br />

      <h3>Symptoms in Rectal Infections (Both Genders):</h3> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Anal discharge</li>
        <li>Itching or soreness in the rectal area</li>
        <li>Rectal bleeding</li>
        <li>Painful bowel movements</li>
      </ul> <br />
      <p>
        Since many people remain asymptomatic, routine testing is crucial to
        identify and treat the infection early.
      </p> <br />
        <h2>How Gonorrhea Affects Different Body Parts</h2> <br />
        <h3>Joints:</h3> <br />
        <p>
          Gonorrhea can spread to the bloodstream, leading to a condition called
          disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). When this happens, the
          bacteria can reach the joints, causing inflammation, joint pain,
          swelling, and redness. If not treated, DGI can result in chronic joint
          damage or arthritis.
        </p> <br />

        <h3>Rectum:</h3> <br />
        <p>
          Rectal gonorrhea is caused by exposure to <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>{" "}
          through anal sexual contact with an infected partner. It may lead to
          symptoms such as rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding. If untreated,
          it increases the risk of other STDs, pelvic inflammatory disease
          (PID), and infertility.
        </p> <br />

        <h3>Eyes:</h3> <br />
        <p>
          Gonorrhea can infect the eyes, causing a condition known as
          conjunctivitis. This occurs when the bacteria enter the eye, either
          through direct contact with infected genital secretions or during
          childbirth when a baby passes through an infected birth canal.
          Symptoms of gonococcal conjunctivitis include redness, discharge,
          itching, and irritation of the eyes. In newborns, this infection is
          known as ophthalmia neonatorum and can lead to severe complications,
          including blindness, if not promptly treated.
        </p> <br />
      <h2>Transmission of Gonorrhea</h2> <br />
      <p>
        Gonorrhea is transmitted during vaginal, oral, or anal sexual activity
        with an infected person. The bacteria spread through bodily fluids such
        as semen, pre-ejaculate, and vaginal secretions. It’s important to note
        that ejaculation is not required for transmission.
      </p> <br />
      <p>
        Additionally, gonorrhea can be transmitted from mother to child during
        childbirth. If a baby contracts gonorrhea during birth, it can result in
        serious health complications such as blindness, joint infections, or
        life-threatening blood infections. To prevent transmission, the CDC
        recommends that pregnant women undergo routine testing and treatment as
        necessary.
      </p> <br />

      

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2> <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of contracting gonorrhea.
        However, certain groups are at a higher risk, including:
      </p> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Young Adults and Teenagers:</b> Higher rates are seen in
          individuals in their teens and early 20s.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>People with Multiple Partners:</b> Engaging in sexual activity with
          multiple partners increases the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM):</b> The risk is higher among men
          who have sexual contact with other men.
        </li>
      </ul> <br />
      <p>The CDC recommends annual screening for the following groups:</p> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Women under the age of 25</li>
        <li>
          Women over 25 with new or multiple sex partners or partners with STDs
        </li>
        <li>Men who have sex with men (MSM)</li>
      </ul> <br />

      

      <h2>Prevalence of Gonorrhea</h2> <br />
      <p> <br />
        Gonorrhea is one of the most common STDs worldwide. According to the
        World Health Organization (WHO), around 78 million people globally are
        infected with gonorrhea annually. Prevalence rates vary significantly by
        region, with higher rates in some areas compared to others.
      </p> <br />
      <p>
        In the United States, gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported
        bacterial STD, with an estimated 635,000 new cases reported annually.
        This figure may be an underestimate since asymptomatic individuals often
        go untested. Factors such as access to sexual health resources,
        education, and public health efforts play a crucial role in determining
        the prevalence of gonorrhea in a given community.
      </p> <br />

      

      <h2>Prevention of Gonorrhea</h2> <br />
      <p>
        While the only guaranteed way to prevent gonorrhea is abstaining from
        sexual activity, there are several effective prevention methods for
        sexually active individuals:
      </p> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Use Protection:</b> Consistent use of condoms or dental dams during
          oral, vaginal, and anal sex significantly reduces the risk of
          transmission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mutual Monogamy:</b> Engaging in a monogamous relationship with a
          partner who has tested negative for STDs reduces the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Routine Testing:</b> Regular testing ensures early detection and
          treatment, preventing further transmission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Open Communication:</b> Discussing sexual health with partners and
          knowing their STD status is an important step in prevention.
        </li>
      </ul> <br />

      

      <h2>What is Gonococcus?</h2> <br />
      <p>
        The term “Gonococcus” refers to the bacterium{" "}
        <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, the microorganism responsible for causing
        gonorrhea. This bacterium was first identified in 1879 by German
        physician Albert Neisser, after whom the species is named. The term
        comes from Greek roots, where “gonos” means seed or offspring, and
        “kokkos” means berry, reflecting the bacterium’s round, berry-like
        appearance under a microscope.
      </p> <br />
      <p>
        Gonococcus can be transmitted through sexual contact or from mother to
        child during childbirth. Once inside the body, the bacterium multiplies
        and causes inflammation in the affected organs, such as the reproductive
        system, rectum, throat, or eyes. Its ability to infect multiple parts of
        the body underscores the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.
