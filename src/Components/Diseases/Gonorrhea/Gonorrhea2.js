      <p>
        Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection categorized as a sexually transmitted disease (STD). 
        It spreads through vaginal, anal, or oral sexual contact. While gonorrhea is easily treatable with antibiotics, 
        many individuals remain unaware they are infected due to mild, vague, or absent symptoms. If left untreated, 
        the infection can cause severe long-term health complications, including infertility.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: '20px', color: '#333' }}>Symptoms of Gonorrhea</h2>
      <p>
        Gonorrhea often goes undetected because many individuals experience no symptoms. Studies reveal that 10–15% of 
        infected men and up to 80% of infected women are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, they are often mild and 
        can be misinterpreted as other health conditions, underscoring the importance of regular testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In men, symptoms usually appear 2–7 days after infection but may take up to 30 days. For women, symptoms generally 
        surface within 2–10 days but, in some cases, may take months to manifest.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: '20px', color: '#333' }}>Symptoms in Women</h3>
      <p>
        Women with gonorrhea frequently do not display symptoms, or the symptoms may be so mild they are mistaken for a urinary 
        or vaginal infection.

      <ul>

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: '20px', color: '#333' }}>Symptoms in Men</h3>
      <p>
        Men are more likely to experience noticeable symptoms of gonorrhea than women. However, some men may also remain 
        asymptomatic, delaying diagnosis and treatment.
