      <h2>Overview of HIV</h2>
      <p>
        HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is the virus responsible for causing AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV weakens the immune system by attacking CD4 cells (T cells), which are essential for fighting infections. Over time, HIV can damage the immune system to the point where the body cannot fight infections and diseases that would otherwise be manageable.
      </p>

      <h2>What is HIV?</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS. It attacks the immune system, leaving individuals vulnerable to diseases. The virus is spread through body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. 
      </p>

      <h2>How is HIV Transmitted?</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is transmitted through specific body fluids:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood</li>
        <li>Semen</li>
        <li>Vaginal fluids</li>
        <li>Anal fluids/mucus</li>
        <li>Breast milk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Key transmission methods include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unprotected sexual contact (vaginal or anal sex)</li>
        <li>Shared needles or syringes (drug use)</li>
        <li>Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        HIV cannot be transmitted through saliva, tears, sweat, casual contact like hugging or shaking hands, mosquitoes or insects, or using shared toilets or utensils.
      </p>

      <h2>How Common is HIV?</h2>
      <p>
        Over 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV, with around 14% unaware of their infection. Although there is no cure for HIV, modern treatments like antiretroviral therapy (ART) allow people with HIV to live long, healthy lives and prevent further transmission of the virus.
      </p>

      <h2>Is HIV Serious?</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is a chronic condition that can lead to AIDS if untreated. AIDS represents the advanced stage of HIV infection, where the immune system is severely damaged. Without treatment, HIV typically progresses to AIDS in 8-10 years. However, with ART, people with HIV can live healthy lives and prevent the progression to AIDS.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms of HIV</h2>
      <h3>Acute HIV Infection</h3>
      <p>
        Acute HIV infection can cause flu-like symptoms, which may appear 2-4 weeks after exposure. These symptoms include fever, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle aches.
      </p>

      <h3>Chronic HIV</h3>
      <p>
        Many individuals may remain symptom-free for years, during which the virus continues to replicate and damage the immune system. Symptoms may not appear until the virus has severely weakened the immune system.
      </p>

      <h2>Can You Get HIV More Than Once?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you are infected with HIV, the virus stays in your body for life. However, effective treatment can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, preventing further damage to your immune system.
      </p>

      <h2>How Is HIV Diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is diagnosed through blood tests that detect antibodies or antigens to the virus. Early detection is crucial to begin treatment and manage the virus effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is at Risk for HIV?</h2>
      <p>
        Certain groups are at higher risk for HIV, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Men who have sex with men</li>
        <li>Individuals with multiple sexual partners</li>
        <li>People who inject drugs and share needles</li>
        <li>Individuals with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preventing HIV</h2>
      <p>
        Preventing HIV involves:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using condoms during sexual activity</li>
        <li>Taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for high-risk individuals</li>
        <li>Getting tested regularly</li>
        <li>Avoiding sharing needles or syringes</li>
        <li>Communicating openly about HIV status with potential partners</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is There a Vaccine for HIV?</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent HIV. However, ongoing research is exploring potential vaccines, with mRNA-based HIV vaccines being tested for their effectiveness in prevention.
      </p>

      <h2>Is HIV Curable?</h2>
      <p>
        As of now, HIV is not curable. However, treatments like antiretroviral therapy (ART) can manage the virus effectively, allowing individuals to live long, healthy lives. Some rare cases of "functional cure" have been achieved through complex procedures, but these are not applicable for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is a serious but manageable condition. With early detection and proper treatment, individuals with HIV can lead healthy lives and prevent the virus from progressing to AIDS. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for testing and treatment options.
