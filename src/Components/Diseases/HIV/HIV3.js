      <h2>HIV Symptoms in Men</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or vaginal fluid. Engaging in unprotected vaginal or anal sex (or oral sex if you have cuts or open sores in your mouth) with an infected partner significantly increases the risk of contracting HIV. HIV can also spread through unsterile drug use, including sharing needles, syringes, or drug paraphernalia.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can HIV Be Transmitted if the Man Doesn’t Ejaculate?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, HIV can be transmitted even if ejaculation does not occur. Pre-seminal fluid, which can contain HIV, is released before ejaculation and can transmit the virus. If the infected individual has a high viral load, the chances of contracting HIV from pre-seminal fluid increase. However, if the viral load is undetectable, HIV cannot be passed through bodily fluids. Managing viral load effectively through treatment can significantly reduce the transmission risk.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>HIV and its Survival Outside the Body</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV does not survive long outside the human body. If semen or blood is exposed to air for a period of time, the risk of transmission is very low.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Early HIV Symptoms in Men (Acute Stage)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the first 2 to 4 weeks after infection, many men will experience flu-like symptoms, which are often mistaken for common illnesses. About 80% of individuals with an acute HIV infection will exhibit the following symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Body rash</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Severe headaches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Less common symptoms in this stage may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Mouth ulcers</li>
        <li>Genital sores</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Muscle aches and joint pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Symptoms in the acute stage typically last between one and two weeks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Asymptomatic Stage of HIV in Men</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the initial symptoms subside, the virus enters the asymptomatic stage, during which the individual may not show any signs of infection. This stage can last for months or even years. However, even though symptoms are not present, HIV remains active in the body, attacking vital immune cells. It is important to note that the virus is still transmissible during this period, and regular HIV testing is recommended, even if no symptoms are present.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Advanced Stage of HIV: AIDS</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS, a stage in which the immune system is severely weakened. This occurs when the virus has significantly damaged the body’s immune system, making the person more susceptible to other infections. Individuals with AIDS often experience repeated infections that a healthy immune system would usually be able to combat.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Symptoms of AIDS in Men:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent diarrhea</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
        <li>Chronic fatigue</li>
        <li>Sores or ulcers in the mouth</li>
        <li>Sores or ulcers on the genitals</li>
        <li>Recurring fever</li>
        <li>Recurring chills</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Coughing</li>
        <li>Prolonged lymph node swelling</li>
        <li>Memory loss, confusion, or neurological disorders</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention and Safe Practices</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV can be prevented by using condoms correctly. Latex condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV transmission, though oil-based lubricants can weaken the condom material. Using water-based lubricants is a safe choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting tested for HIV is the only definitive way to know if you have contracted the virus. The CDC recommends regular HIV testing at least once a year or whenever you engage in high-risk activities like unprotected sex or sharing needles. It is essential to know your HIV status to ensure early treatment and prevent the spread of the virus to others.
