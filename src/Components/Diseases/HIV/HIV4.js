      <h2>What is HIV and How is it Transmitted?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is transmitted through direct contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or other bodily fluids. Engaging in unprotected vaginal or anal sex (or oral sex if there is an open wound in the mouth) with an infected partner significantly increases the likelihood of contracting HIV. The virus can also spread through the use of unsterile needles or syringes, such as those used in intravenous drug use. Although HIV is most commonly transmitted through vaginal sex in women, anal sex remains the highest-risk activity for both contracting and spreading the virus.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can Women Get HIV?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2014, women accounted for 19% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States. Most women contract HIV through sexual contact with an infected male partner. According to the CDC, 87% of these cases were linked to heterosexual sex, while 13% were associated with intravenous drug use.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>HIV in Women</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The number of new HIV cases in women has decreased significantly from 2005 to 2014, dropping by 40%. Despite this progress, African American women continue to make up the majority of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. In 2014, the racial breakdown of new HIV cases in women was as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>62% were African American (5,128 diagnoses)</li>
        <li>18% were White (1,483 diagnoses)</li>
        <li>16% were Hispanic (1,350 diagnoses)</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Women and AIDS</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Women represent about 25% of the estimated 20,792 AIDS diagnoses in 2014, and one-fifth of the total 1,210,835 AIDS diagnoses in the U.S. since the beginning of the epidemic. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for HIV in women.

      <h2>HIV Symptoms in Women</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The symptoms of HIV vary from person to person, but there are common patterns associated with the infection. Early signs can often be mistaken for flu or cold symptoms. It may take 2-4 weeks after infection for symptoms to appear, and around 80% of individuals with an acute HIV infection experience flu-like symptoms. However, in some cases, it may take years before symptoms are noticeable, which is why regular testing is essential for early detection and treatment.

      <br />
      <h3>Early Signs of HIV in Women</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The early symptoms of HIV in women can resemble those of a cold or flu. These may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Body rash</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Severe headaches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Less common symptoms at this stage may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Mouth ulcers</li>
        <li>Vaginal infections (such as yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis)</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Muscle aches and joint pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Symptoms during the acute HIV stage usually last from one to two weeks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Asymptomatic Stage of HIV in Women</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the acute HIV symptoms subside, the disease may enter an asymptomatic stage. During this period, an individual may not exhibit any signs or symptoms for months or even years. Despite the lack of symptoms, the virus continues to replicate and attack the immune system, weakening the body’s defenses. The virus remains active during this stage and can still be transmitted to others. Regular testing is crucial during this time, as individuals may not feel ill but can still spread the virus.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Advanced Stage of HIV – AIDS Symptoms in Women</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), a stage in which the immune system is severely compromised. This makes the body much more vulnerable to infections that would otherwise be manageable. People with AIDS frequently experience recurring infections, such as colds, the flu, and fungal infections. Symptoms of AIDS in women include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent diarrhea</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Sores or ulcers in the mouth</li>
        <li>Vaginal infections, including yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis</li>
        <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</li>
        <li>Recurring fever, chills, and night sweats</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath and coughing</li>
        <li>Persistent swelling of lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Memory loss, confusion, or other neurological issues</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>HIV and Pregnancy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during childbirth (a process known as perinatal HIV) or through breastfeeding. However, with proper care, the risk of transmission can be significantly reduced. Pregnant women should be tested for HIV as part of routine prenatal care, and antiretroviral treatments may be prescribed to prevent the transmission of HIV to the baby. In some cases, a cesarean section may be recommended, along with continued antiretroviral therapy for the child after birth.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HIV is a serious virus that can lead to AIDS if left untreated, but with early detection and effective treatment, individuals can manage the virus and prevent it from advancing. HIV testing is essential, even for those who do not exhibit symptoms, as early treatment helps reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others and improves overall health outcomes.
