      <h2>AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the final and most severe stage of HIV infection, occurring when the immune system has been severely damaged due to the progression of HIV. Without treatment, HIV can weaken the immune system over months or years to the point where it is no longer able to defend the body from infections and illnesses. As a result, individuals with AIDS are more susceptible to various infections and diseases that they would normally be able to fight off. It is common for people with AIDS to experience frequent colds, the flu, or fungal infections as their immune system becomes compromised.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of AIDS in Men and Women</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        AIDS can cause a wide range of symptoms, which may vary between individuals. Common symptoms of AIDS include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent diarrhea</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
        <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
        <li>Mouth sores or ulcers</li>
        <li>Recurring fever</li>
        <li>Recurring chills</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Persistent coughing</li>
        <li>Prolonged swelling of lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Memory loss, confusion, or neurological disorders</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For women, additional symptoms may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaginal infections, such as yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis</li>
        <li>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Signs of AIDS</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        AIDS is the last and most severe stage of HIV infection. People diagnosed with AIDS have severely weakened immune systems, making them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. Some of the symptoms that may indicate the onset of AIDS include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent, unexplained fatigue</li>
        <li>Unexplained rapid weight loss</li>
        <li>Frequent fever</li>
        <li>Chills</li>
        <li>Severe night sweats</li>
        <li>Continuous diarrhea</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
        <li>Pneumonia symptoms, such as coughing, shortness of breath, and fever</li>
        <li>Sores around the mouth, genitals, or anus</li>
        <li>Skin rashes and other skin issues</li>
        <li>Cognitive impairments like memory loss, depression, or other neurological problems</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>AIDS Wasting Syndrome</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        AIDS wasting syndrome, also known as cachexia, refers to the involuntary loss of at least 10% of body weight, primarily affecting muscle mass. It is often seen in untreated individuals with AIDS and can be accompanied by symptoms such as weakness, fever, and diarrhea. Wasting syndrome can significantly worsen the condition, leading to greater health complications and an increased risk of death. For this reason, it is crucial for individuals with HIV to take antiretroviral medications and maintain proper nutrition.
      </p>

      <h2>Is AIDS an STD? How Do You Get AIDS?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        AIDS is a life-threatening disease caused by the HIV virus. While HIV is the virus, AIDS is the resulting disease when the immune system is severely damaged. Yes, AIDS is considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD) because HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is often transmitted through sexual contact. You can become infected with HIV, which can later develop into AIDS, by engaging in vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person. The virus can be transmitted through their vaginal secretions, semen, or blood entering your body during sexual contact. Additionally, HIV can be transmitted non-sexually through breast milk, shared needles, or blood transfusions from an infected person.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>HIV/AIDS Prevention</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Preventing HIV infection is essential in reducing the risk of developing AIDS. To prevent HIV transmission, it is important to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use condoms during vaginal, anal, and oral sex to protect yourself and your partner.</li>
        <li>Use dental dams specifically for oral sex.</li>
        <li>Get tested for HIV through an HIV RNA Early Detection Test or HIV 1 & 2 Antibody Test, either individually or with a new partner, to know your status and prevent the spread of the virus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early detection and prevention can provide peace of mind and help reduce the spread of HIV to others.
