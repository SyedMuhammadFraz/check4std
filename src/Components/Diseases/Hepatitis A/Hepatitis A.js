      <h2>What is Hepatitis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver, which can hinder its normal functioning. This condition may arise from excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to harmful toxins, certain medications, and specific medical conditions, particularly viral infections such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What is Hepatitis A?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis A (HAV) is a highly contagious liver infection that typically manifests suddenly and severely. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not lead to chronic liver disease. The infection, caused by the hepatitis A virus, can range from mild, lasting only a few weeks, to severe, persisting for several months. Most people recover from hepatitis A without medical treatment, requiring only rest and hydration.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Symptoms of Hepatitis A in Adults</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevalence of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A is one of the most common types of hepatitis in the United States, along with hepatitis B and C. The introduction of the hepatitis A vaccine in 1995 led to a significant reduction in infection rates, with only about 4,000 cases reported in 2016. Hepatitis A is more prevalent in developing countries.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Severity of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A typically causes temporary illness, and most people recover fully without long-term liver damage. However, in rare cases, it can lead to liver failure or death, particularly in individuals over 50 or those with pre-existing liver conditions.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Causes of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A is found in the blood and stool of infected individuals. It is highly contagious and can be transmitted in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consuming food or water contaminated with the virus during any stage of production (growth, harvesting, processing, or shipping).</li>
        <li>Engaging in sexual activity involving oral-anal contact with an infected person.</li>
        <li>Close personal contact with an infected person, especially if they have poor hygiene.</li>
        <li>Sharing drug-injection equipment with an infected individual.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Transmission of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A spreads primarily through the ingestion of food or drinks contaminated with fecal matter containing the virus, even in microscopic amounts. It can also be transmitted through sexual activities, particularly those involving oral-anal contact.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Contagious Period of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        A person infected with hepatitis A becomes most contagious shortly after contracting the virus, even before symptoms appear. They remain contagious for about two weeks after symptoms begin. People with compromised immune systems may remain contagious for up to six months.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Risk Factors for Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p>
        Certain groups of people are more susceptible to hepatitis A, including those who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Live in areas with limited access to clean water.</li>
        <li>Reside with an infected person.</li>
        <li>Have poor sanitation or hygiene.</li>
        <li>Engage in sexual activity without vaccination.</li>
        <li>Participate in oral-anal sexual activity.</li>
        <li>Travel to countries with high rates of hepatitis A.</li>
        <li>Work with non-human primates.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <p><strong>Vaccination</strong> The most effective way to prevent hepatitis A is through vaccination. The CDC recommends hepatitis A vaccination for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Children starting at one year old.</li>
        <li>Travelers to regions where hepatitis A is widespread.</li>
        <li>Family members or caregivers of adoptees from high-risk countries.</li>
        <li>Individuals engaging in anal sex.</li>
        <li>People who use recreational drugs, injected or not.</li>
        <li>Those living in unsanitary conditions or experiencing homelessness.</li>
        <li>People with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis B or C.</li>
        <li>People with blood clotting disorders.</li>
        <li>Individuals in close contact with infected persons.</li>
        <li>Anyone seeking protection from hepatitis A.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <p><strong>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)</strong> If a person is exposed to hepatitis A, they can receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. PEP involves receiving an injection of the hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin (Ig) within two weeks of exposure to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

      <br />
      <h2>Other Preventive Measures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after using the bathroom or changing diapers.</li>
        <li>Ensure food is prepared in sanitary conditions.</li>
        <li>Avoid consumption of contaminated food and water, especially in areas where hepatitis A is prevalent.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Can You Get Hepatitis A More Than Once?</h2>
      <p>No, once a person contracts and recovers from hepatitis A, they develop antibodies that provide lifelong immunity against the virus.</p>
