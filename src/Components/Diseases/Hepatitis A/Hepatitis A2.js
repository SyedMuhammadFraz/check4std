      <h2>Hepatitis A: What You Need to Know</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver. While habits like heavy alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis, it can also result from viral infections. Hepatitis viruses include types A, B, C, D, and E.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A virus (HAV) symptoms often remain undetected for several weeks after infection. In some cases, individuals infected with hepatitis A may never show symptoms. When symptoms do manifest, they tend to be mild and resolve within a few weeks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <br />
      <p>The symptoms of hepatitis A may include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Low-grade fever</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Dark urine</li>
        <li>Clay-colored bowel movements</li>
        <li>Abdominal discomfort or pain, particularly near the liver</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>When Do Symptoms Appear?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis A symptoms can start appearing approximately four weeks after exposure to the virus. However, symptoms have been reported as early as two weeks and as late as seven weeks post-exposure.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Duration of Symptoms</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The length of time symptoms last varies between individuals. Generally, older individuals may experience longer-lasting symptoms. According to the CDC, about 10â€“15% of individuals with hepatitis A may suffer from severe illness for up to six months.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Complications of Hepatitis A</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Can It Be Fatal?</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike other forms of hepatitis, hepatitis A does not lead to chronic liver disease. However, in extremely rare cases, it can progress to severe liver failure, which may be fatal if untreated.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When Should You See a Doctor?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you believe you have been exposed to hepatitis A or have tested positive, it is important to consult a healthcare provider. Medical attention is especially critical under the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Within Two Weeks of Exposure:</strong> If you suspect exposure to the hepatitis A virus, you may still benefit from a hepatitis A vaccine or an immunoglobulin injection (antibody), which can prevent infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Presence of Symptoms:</strong> If you are experiencing symptoms, consult a doctor for evaluation and treatment options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recent Risk Factors:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Travel to regions with poor sanitation</li>
            <li>Dining at a restaurant linked to a hepatitis A outbreak</li>
            <li>Close contact with someone diagnosed with hepatitis A</li>
            <li>Use of intravenous drugs</li>
            <li>Consumption of raw shellfish</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By staying informed and proactive, you can protect yourself and others from hepatitis A and its potential complications.
