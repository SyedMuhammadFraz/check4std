      <h2>What Is Hepatitis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver, which can hinder its normal functioning. This condition may arise from excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to harmful toxins, certain medications, and specific medical conditions, particularly viral infections such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Is Hepatitis B?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B (HBV) is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the liver. It can lead to severe health issues like liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer. The virus spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids, often during unprotected sexual activity. According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, approximately 80,000 people in the United States contract hepatitis B annually.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Acute Hepatitis B Infection</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        An acute hepatitis B infection occurs within six months of exposure to the virus. It is usually a short-term illness that may either have mild symptoms or be entirely asymptomatic. In rare cases, it can cause severe symptoms that may require hospitalization.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Chronic Hepatitis B Infection</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        If the hepatitis B infection lasts longer than six months, it is classified as chronic. A chronic infection occurs when the immune system is unable to eliminate the virus from the body. This increases the risk of liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other serious liver-related health issues.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Is Hepatitis B Transmitted?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B spreads when bodily fluids such as blood, semen, or vaginal fluids from an infected person enter the body of an uninfected person. This can happen during unprotected sexual activity, childbirth, or through the sharing of needles or other personal items contaminated with infected fluids.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who is not immune to hepatitis B is at risk of infection, but certain factors increase this risk, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Having unprotected sex with multiple partners or with an HBV-infected partner</li>
        <li>Engaging in anal sex or oral-anal contact</li>
        <li>Living with someone who has chronic hepatitis B</li>
        <li>Being an infant born to a mother infected with HBV</li>
        <li>Working in healthcare or jobs with exposure to human blood</li>
        <li>Traveling to areas with high hepatitis B infection rates</li>
        <li>Sharing personal hygiene items like toothbrushes, razors, or glucose monitors</li>
        <li>Direct contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person</li>
        <li>Sharing needles or experiencing accidental needle sticks</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h3>Can Hepatitis B Spread Through Sexual Contact?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, sexual transmission is one of the most common ways hepatitis B spreads in the United States. It accounts for nearly two-thirds of all acute hepatitis B cases. The virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV, and it spreads through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as semen, vaginal fluids, and blood.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The most effective way to prevent hepatitis B is to get vaccinated before being exposed to the virus. The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective in preventing infection. Additional preventive measures include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practicing safe sex by consistently using condoms or dental dams</li>
        <li>Avoiding the sharing of needles and other drug paraphernalia</li>
        <li>Engaging in monogamous sexual relationships with partners who are not infected</li>
        <li>Discussing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) with a partner before becoming sexually active</li>
      </ul>
    </>
