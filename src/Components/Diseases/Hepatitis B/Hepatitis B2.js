      <h2>Hepatitis B: Understanding the Liver Infection</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It
        spreads through blood and bodily fluids, including sexual contact, sharing
        needles, childbirth, and close household contact. Many people with hepatitis
        B are unaware of their infection because it often does not present noticeable
        symptoms, and the infection tends to resolve on its own. However, in some
        cases, hepatitis B can develop into a chronic condition, potentially leading
        to serious liver complications such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, or even death.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis B</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        For most individuals, hepatitis B does not show any symptoms, and they remain
        unaware of their infection. This is why the virus can spread unknowingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If symptoms do develop, they typically surface between 8 weeks and 5 months
        after exposure to the virus, with the average being around 90 days (3 months).
        Symptoms may last for several weeks, though some individuals may feel ill for
        up to 6 months. In cases of chronic hepatitis B, symptoms may be intermittent,
        with many individuals showing no signs until the condition progresses to
        cirrhosis or severe liver disease.
      </p>
      <p>The common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Light or clay-colored stools</li>
        <li>Dark urine</li>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Muscle or joint pain</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting (ranging from mild to severe)</li>
        <li>Abdominal bloating</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Complications of Hepatitis B</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B can present as either a short-term acute illness or a long-term
        chronic infection. The severity varies, and the infection can cause different
        health outcomes depending on its progression:
      </p>
      <h3>Acute Hepatitis B:</h3>
      <p>
        This phase occurs within the first 6 months of infection. Symptoms may vary in
        intensity, with many individuals showing few or no symptoms. In some cases,
        the infection requires hospitalization, but most adults are able to clear the
        virus from their system without treatment and develop immunity.
      </p>
      <h3>Chronic Hepatitis B:</h3>
      <p>
        A persistent infection lasting 6 months or longer. In some individuals, the
        immune system cannot fight off the virus, leading to lifelong infection.
        Chronic hepatitis B increases the risk of serious liver complications,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cirrhosis:</strong> Liver cells are replaced by scar tissue,
          impairing the liver’s ability to function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liver Failure:</strong> Over time, cirrhosis can cause the liver to
          stop working, which can be life-threatening.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liver Cancer:</strong> Individuals with cirrhosis are at a higher
          risk of developing liver cancer and require frequent monitoring.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In rare cases, approximately 1% of people with hepatitis B can develop
        fulminant hepatitis, which leads to rapid liver failure, coma, and can be
        fatal. This condition requires immediate medical attention.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Risk of Acute Hepatitis B Becoming Chronic</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The likelihood of acute hepatitis B progressing to chronic infection depends
        largely on the person's age at the time of infection. Infants and young
        children are more likely to develop chronic hepatitis B, whereas the risk
        decreases with age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC), about 95% of adults with hepatitis B recover fully and do
        not develop a chronic infection. In contrast, around 90% of infected infants
        and 25-50% of children aged 1-5 years old may develop chronic hepatitis B.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most healthy adults, hepatitis B is short-term and resolves on its own,
        without causing lasting damage. However, chronic hepatitis B, along with
        hepatitis C, is a leading cause of liver cancer. According to the CDC, about
        25% of people who contract hepatitis B in childhood and 15% of those infected
        in adulthood will eventually die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. Approximately
        3,000 people in the United States die from hepatitis B-related liver disease
        each year.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Hepatitis B and Pregnancy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pregnant women with hepatitis B can pass the virus to their newborns. Without
        proper intervention, babies born to mothers with hepatitis B have a greater
        than 90% chance of developing chronic hepatitis B. Early testing for hepatitis
        B during pregnancy is essential to protect both the mother and baby from
        long-term complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are pregnant and test positive for hepatitis B, it’s crucial to inform
        your healthcare provider so steps can be taken to prevent transmission to your
        baby. The CDC recommends the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Administer the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to the newborn.</li>
        <li>
          Provide a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), an antibody that helps
          prevent infection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Testing and Prevention</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent hepatitis B infection. The
        hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective, providing immunity to the virus.
        The CDC recommends that all newborns receive the vaccine as part of their
        regular immunization schedule. Adults at risk should also be vaccinated.
