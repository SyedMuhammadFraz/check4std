      <h2>Hepatitis B Overview</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B (HBV) is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It spreads through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for hepatitis B.
      </p>
      <p>
        An acute HBV infection, which lasts for less than 6 months, usually resolves on its own. In some rare cases, chronic HBV infections (those lasting longer than 6 months) may also clear up on their own, though this is not common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doctors typically diagnose hepatitis B through blood tests that detect the virus in the bloodstream.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Our Hepatitis B Antigen Test</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        At STDcheck.com, getting tested for hepatitis B is simple and quick. Our CLIA-certified test centers collect a small blood sample and check for the hepatitis B surface antigen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surface antigen is a protein found on the virus's surface, and it is the first marker of acute hepatitis B. Detecting it early can help diagnose the infection before symptoms appear, allowing for early intervention to prevent further health complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you test positive for hepatitis B, we perform a confirmation test at no extra cost to ensure the accuracy of your results. This test is part of our 10-test panel but is also available separately on our individual test selection page.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How the Test Works</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing for hepatitis B through STDcheck.com is fast and hassle-free. After you place your order, simply walk into a nearby lab, no appointment required. When you arrive, youâ€™ll check in and a phlebotomist will help collect a small blood sample. The whole process takes only a few minutes, and results are usually available within a few days. There is no need for uncomfortable swabbing or undressing.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested for Hepatitis B?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis B can cause liver damage before symptoms even appear, so doctors sometimes test seemingly healthy individuals for the virus. Additionally, people with existing hepatitis B infections are often tested regularly to monitor and guide their treatment.
      </p>
      <p>Doctors may recommend hepatitis B testing for individuals who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are experiencing jaundice or unexplained elevated ALT levels (a liver enzyme).</li>
        <li>Require chemotherapy or immune-suppressing drugs.</li>
        <li>Are being treated for hepatitis B or hepatitis C.</li>
        <li>Are unsure about their immunity and are considering getting the hepatitis B vaccine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other risk factors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unprotected sex</li>
        <li>Sharing needles during intravenous drug use</li>
        <li>Being a man who has sex with other men (MSM)</li>
        <li>Living with someone who has chronic HBV</li>
        <li>Being born to an infected mother</li>
        <li>Having a job that exposes you to blood</li>
        <li>Traveling to areas with high HBV infection rates</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>When to Get Tested</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        To detect a hepatitis B infection, your body needs time after exposure to develop antibodies against the virus. This incubation period typically lasts 3 to 6 weeks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Doctors will assess your symptoms, risk factors, and travel history, then perform blood tests to confirm a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Your Results Mean</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The hepatitis B surface antigen test can result in one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Positive results:</strong> Indicates the surface antigen was found in your blood, which means you may have an acute or recent hepatitis B infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Negative results:</strong> Indicates the surface antigen was not detected, meaning there is no active infection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To determine whether the infection has progressed from acute to chronic, consult a doctor or retest after 6 months to check if the infection has resolved. If hepatitis B has not cleared within 6 months, it may have become chronic, and a healthcare provider can help guide appropriate treatment.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treatment for Hepatitis B</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Treatment for acute hepatitis B is generally not required, as most healthy adults recover within the first year without complications. The infection typically clears on its own, though rest, hydration, and a healthy diet are recommended while the body fights off the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chronic hepatitis B infections cannot be cured, but antiviral treatments can help slow the progression of liver damage. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential to prevent further complications such as cirrhosis or liver failure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Liver transplant:</strong> In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immune modulator drugs:</strong> Boost the immune system, typically used for younger patients or women planning pregnancy. Not recommended during pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Antiviral drugs:</strong> Oral medications that reduce liver inflammation and damage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Can I Get Hepatitis B Again?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Once you have recovered from hepatitis B, your body develops antibodies that protect you from future infections. Therefore, you cannot get hepatitis B again.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Hepatitis B Vaccine</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The best way to prevent hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated before exposure to the virus. Receiving the hepatitis B vaccine and/or hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 24 hours of exposure may prevent the infection.
