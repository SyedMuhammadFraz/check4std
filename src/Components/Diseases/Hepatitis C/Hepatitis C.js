      <h2>Overview of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis refers to the inflammation of the liver, which can result from factors like excessive alcohol consumption, certain medications, or specific medical conditions. One major cause of hepatitis is viral infections, with the most common types being hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. These infections are all caused by viruses, but hepatitis B and C are particularly known for leading to severe liver damage such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. If you suspect you have been infected with hepatitis, it is essential to get tested and begin appropriate treatment. Click here to learn more about our hepatitis C test.

      <h2>What is Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that affects the liver. This condition can vary in severity, ranging from a mild, short-term illness to a chronic, long-term disease that may cause significant health complications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some individuals may recover from acute hepatitis C, while others may experience it as a chronic illness that can lead to severe liver damage if left untreated.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Contract Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        HCV is primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact. This can occur through several means, including blood transfusions (before 1992), sharing needles for drug use, receiving tattoos or piercings from unregulated sources, and sexual contact. Although sexual transmission is less common compared to other forms of hepatitis, the likelihood of spreading the virus increases if the infected individual also has other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Stages of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Acute Stage</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        During the acute phase of infection, individuals may experience mild symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. This stage typically lasts up to six months, and in some cases, the body may clear the virus on its own. If the virus is not cleared, it progresses into chronic hepatitis C.
      </p>

      <h3>Chronic Stage</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        In cases where the infection is not eradicated within the first six months, it becomes a chronic condition. About 75-80% of individuals with acute hepatitis C will develop chronic hepatitis C, which can lead to long-term liver damage. At this point, antiviral medications are available to help manage the condition and prevent complications.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The symptoms of hepatitis C typically appear 2 to 12 weeks after exposure to the virus. However, many people with hepatitis C show no symptoms at all, even though they can still transmit the virus.
      </p>

      <h3>Acute Hepatitis C Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Easy bruising or bleeding</li>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
        <li>Dark-colored urine</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Swelling in the legs</li>
        <li>Confusion or slurred speech</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chronic Hepatitis C Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Chronic hepatitis C often shares symptoms with the acute form but can progress to more severe health issues if not treated. Chronic infection can lead to complications such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Complications of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If left untreated, chronic hepatitis C can cause serious complications, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severe liver damage</li>
        <li>Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)</li>
        <li>Liver cancer</li>
        <li>Liver failure</li>
        <li>Need for a liver transplant</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Risk Factors for Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Certain behaviors and activities increase the risk of contracting hepatitis C. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Receiving a blood transfusion before 1992</li>
        <li>Injecting drugs and sharing needles</li>
        <li>Getting tattoos or body piercings from unregulated sources</li>
        <li>Engaging in unprotected sex, especially with multiple partners</li>
        <li>Healthcare workers or sex workers</li>
        <li>Having multiple tattoos, particularly from non-professional settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Research also shows a higher prevalence of HCV among those who have received tattoos in unprofessional settings or with reused needles.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Unlike hepatitis A and B, there is no vaccine available for hepatitis C. Therefore, prevention involves taking precautions to reduce the risk of transmission. Some key preventive measures include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid direct contact with other people’s blood</li>
        <li>Use protective barriers like condoms during sexual activity</li>
        <li>Ensure that tattoos or piercings are done with clean, sterilized equipment</li>
        <li>Refrain from sharing needles or personal items that may be contaminated with blood</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Is Hepatitis C Curable?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is curable. Many people’s bodies can naturally clear the virus during the acute stage. For those with chronic hepatitis C, antiviral medications can effectively manage the virus and prevent further liver damage. These treatments can lead to sustained viral eradication in most cases.
