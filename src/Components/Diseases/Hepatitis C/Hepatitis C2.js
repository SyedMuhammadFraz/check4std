      <h2>Hepatitis C: An Overview</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is an infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which leads to inflammation of the liver. Many individuals with hepatitis C remain unaware of their infection because the condition often does not cause symptoms. While hepatitis C can be an acute (short-term) illness, it most frequently becomes chronic and can last a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without appropriate treatment, hepatitis C can lead to severe complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. In fact, hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Acute vs. Chronic Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Acute Hepatitis C</h3>
      <p>
        Acute hepatitis C refers to the initial stage of the infection that occurs within the first 6 months after exposure to the virus. Around 15%-20% of individuals infected with HCV are able to clear the virus naturally without treatment. However, for most people, acute hepatitis C will develop into chronic hepatitis C.
      </p>
      <h3>Chronic Hepatitis C</h3>
      <p>
        Chronic hepatitis C is a long-term infection that persists for more than 6 months. It is difficult for the immune system to eliminate the virus on its own, which allows it to remain in the body and gradually damage the liver over time.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Early Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        In many cases, hepatitis C does not cause noticeable symptoms initially. If symptoms do appear, they typically develop 2-12 weeks after infection and can be mild and non-specific. Early symptoms may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Dark urine</li>
        <li>Clay-colored stool</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Delayed Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        Hepatitis C can remain asymptomatic for years or even decades. As the liver becomes more damaged, symptoms may develop. In chronic cases, signs of advanced liver disease include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Abdominal swelling</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain or tenderness</li>
        <li>Jaundice</li>
        <li>Easy bleeding or bruising</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Hepatic encephalopathy (disorientation, difficulty thinking, drowsiness, changes in personality, confusion)</li>
        <li>Rashes, hives, or itchy skin</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Can a Person Without Symptoms Spread Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, individuals with hepatitis C can spread the virus to others even if they don't exhibit symptoms. The most common way hepatitis C spreads is through contact with infected blood. This can happen through sharing needles, from mother to baby during birth, unregulated tattoos or piercings, or sometimes through sexual contact.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Complications of Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        While some cases of hepatitis C are mild and self-limiting, the majority of infections—about 75%-80%—progress to chronic hepatitis C. Over time, chronic hepatitis C can lead to serious liver damage and complications, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Liver Damage: The hepatitis C virus causes inflammation and gradual liver damage.</li>
        <li>Cirrhosis: Severe scarring of the liver that impairs liver function.</li>
        <li>Liver Failure and Transplantation: Liver failure may occur after long-term damage.</li>
        <li>Liver Cancer: Increased risk of liver cancer, especially with cirrhosis.</li>
        <li>Toxins in the Brain: Build-up of toxins can cause hepatic encephalopathy.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Hepatitis C and HIV</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Individuals with HIV are at higher risk for contracting hepatitis C due to the weakened immune system caused by HIV. Hepatitis C can progress more rapidly in people with HIV. In the U.S., approximately 25% of individuals living with HIV are also infected with hepatitis C.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Hepatitis C and Pregnancy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pregnant women with hepatitis C can transmit the virus to their babies, with the risk estimated at about 6 in 100 births. The risk of transmission is higher if the mother is also HIV-positive.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have been exposed to hepatitis C, are showing symptoms, or were born between 1945 and 1965, it's important to get tested for hepatitis C. A simple blood test can detect hepatitis C antibodies, even before severe liver damage occurs. Early detection, monitoring, and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of liver damage.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Testing and Treatment for Hepatitis C</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing: A blood test can help determine if you have hepatitis C. It detects antibodies against the virus, which indicate that you have been exposed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment: Hepatitis C treatment has improved significantly in recent years. Modern antiviral medications can cure the infection in most people. The treatment duration and specific medications vary depending on the type of hepatitis C and the severity of liver damage.
