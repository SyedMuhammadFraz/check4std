      <h2>Hepatitis C Testing Information</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes inflammation in the liver and is the leading cause of liver cancer and liver transplants. The condition can either present as a mild, short-term illness or evolve into a severe, chronic disease. Approximately 75-85% of individuals with hepatitis C will develop a chronic infection, which can lead to serious liver damage, liver failure, or liver cancer if left untreated.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Is the Test Performed?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C testing is done through a blood test that detects antibodies for the HCV virus. After infection, your body produces antibodies to try and fight the virus. The test requires a quick and simple blood draw from your arm to collect a small sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get tested for HCV at one of our nearby testing centers. Once you order your test online, you can visit the lab without an appointment, and most results are available within 1-2 business days.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When Should You Get Tested?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It takes time for the body to recognize the virus and produce antibodies after exposure to HCV. Our hepatitis C test is highly sensitive and can detect antibodies as early as 8-9 weeks after initial infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the test is done too soon, before the window period has passed, a false negative result might occur. In such cases, it's recommended to take a follow-up test three months after the potential exposure to confirm if there’s an active infection.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested for Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is primarily spread when blood contaminated with the virus enters the bloodstream of someone who is not infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends hepatitis C testing for individuals who are at high risk, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Current or former injection drug users</li>
        <li>Individuals born between 1945 and 1965</li>
        <li>People who received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992</li>
        <li>People who received clotting factor concentrates before 1987</li>
        <li>Individuals with HIV</li>
        <li>People who have undergone long-term hemodialysis</li>
        <li>Individuals with persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels</li>
        <li>People who have had a needlestick injury with HCV-positive blood</li>
        <li>Individuals born to an HCV-positive mother</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What Do Your Test Results Mean?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The results of a hepatitis C antibody test can either be non-reactive (negative) or reactive (positive):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Reactive/Negative:</strong> No antibodies were found, indicating that you don’t have the virus. However, if the exposure to the virus was recent, the test may need to be repeated at a later time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reactive/Positive:</strong> Antibodies were detected, meaning you either have an active infection or have been infected with hepatitis C in the past. Once infected, the body retains antibodies for life, even if the virus is no longer active.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What Happens if I’m Positive?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Receiving a positive hepatitis C result may be overwhelming, but if you test positive, we’re here to support you. Additional testing for HCV RNA can confirm whether the virus is active. If HCV RNA is found, it indicates an active infection, while its absence means the virus is not currently present.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also offer phone consultations with doctors to explain what hepatitis C means for your health, provide guidance on next steps, and discuss your treatment options. Depending on your specific situation, you may or may not require drug treatment.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can Hepatitis C Go Away Without Treatment?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In some cases, 15-25% of people can naturally clear acute hepatitis C without treatment, particularly in the first several weeks after infection. However, most individuals progress to chronic infection, which requires treatment. Chronic hepatitis C needs continuous monitoring to check for signs of liver damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of 20-30 years, 10-20% of those with chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis (severe liver scarring). Blood tests, imaging tests, and liver biopsies can help assess liver health and the extent of damage.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Is Hepatitis C Curable?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, hepatitis C is curable. Advances in antiviral treatments now offer a cure for over 90% of individuals infected with hepatitis C. The virus is considered cured when HCV RNA is undetectable in blood tests for 24 weeks after treatment, a status known as a sustained virologic response (SVR).
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Is Hepatitis C Treated?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The treatment for chronic hepatitis C typically involves antiviral medications that aim to reduce the virus in your system, halt liver damage, and prevent complications such as cirrhosis or liver cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs available, most of which are taken orally for 8-12 weeks. The exact treatment depends on factors like liver scarring and the type (genotype) of the virus. Some medications are used in combination for enhanced effectiveness.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Liver Transplants</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In cases of advanced chronic hepatitis C, where cirrhosis has severely damaged the liver, a liver transplant may be required. The procedure involves replacing the damaged liver with a healthy donor liver. However, a transplant does not eliminate the virus from the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a liver transplant, antiviral treatments and other medications may be prescribed to cure hepatitis C, so it's essential to discuss your treatment options with your healthcare provider.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can You Get Re-infected?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, it is possible to get re-infected with hepatitis C even if you’ve had the infection before. This is especially common among people who inject drugs. Additionally, you can contract other types of viral hepatitis, including hepatitis A and B, or develop hepatitis caused by alcohol or drug use.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Is There a Vaccine for Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Currently, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C. However, getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B can help prevent these liver infections, which may complicate chronic hepatitis C. The best way to prevent hepatitis C is to avoid contact with infected blood by following these safety practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid injecting intravenous drugs</li>
        <li>Don’t share personal items like razors or toothbrushes that may have blood on them</li>
        <li>Always use a condom during sex</li>
        <li>Follow workplace safety protocols if at risk for exposure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you believe you’ve been exposed to hepatitis C or are at high risk, getting tested is the first step to ensuring proper care. Early detection is critical to preventing serious long-term health issues.
