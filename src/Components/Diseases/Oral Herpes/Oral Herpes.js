      <h2>What is Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are several strains of HSV, with HSV-1 and HSV-2 being the most common. Herpes may not always show symptoms, but when symptoms do appear, the most noticeable sign is typically a painful outbreak of blisters.

      <br />
      <h2>What is Oral Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Oral herpes refers to the location on the body where the herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes symptoms, such as cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth. Oral herpes can be caused by either HSV-1 or HSV-2, although it's more commonly associated with HSV-1. However, it is important to note that both strains of the virus can cause oral herpes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a common misconception that oral herpes is always caused by HSV-1, but both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can lead to oral outbreaks. This misconception arises because HSV-1 is more commonly found in the oral area. Testing for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 is recommended if you're concerned about herpes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the herpes simplex virus enters the body, it infects skin cells and then moves deeper into the nerve cells, where it remains dormant, which makes it difficult to study. Infected individuals may experience symptoms, but these can also appear without warning. Cold sores are the most common symptom of oral herpes.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Causes of Oral Herpes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Oral herpes is extremely contagious and can spread through skin-to-skin contact, such as kissing, or through touching surfaces that have the virus. While sexual contact can transmit herpes, you don’t need to engage in sexual activity to contract it; kissing and sharing drinks or personal items like lip balm are common ways the virus is spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        HSV is most contagious when open sores are present and fluid is released, but viral shedding can occur even when there are no visible symptoms, meaning the virus can still be transmitted. This makes it challenging to prevent the spread, especially during times of asymptomatic viral shedding.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Is Oral Herpes Contagious?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, oral herpes is highly contagious and can be spread easily through activities such as kissing, touching, or sharing drinks and utensils. Even if there are no visible sores, viral shedding can still occur, meaning the virus can be transmitted.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Common Is Oral Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Oral herpes is very common, with over half of all adults in the U.S. affected by it, most often caused by HSV-1. Despite the high prevalence, the stigma attached to oral herpes is unnecessary, as it is a widespread and typically non-serious infection. According to the American Sexual Health Association (ASHA), the majority of adults carry oral herpes without significant issues.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Serious Is Oral Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although oral herpes can cause discomfort, such as painful cold sores, it is generally not considered a serious health condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend routine testing for herpes unless there are symptoms, stating that the stigma associated with testing and diagnosing herpes can outweigh the benefits. Oral herpes usually causes mild symptoms and does not lead to severe health problems for most individuals.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Is at Risk for Oral Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone can contract oral herpes, regardless of cleanliness or lifestyle. It is important to understand that having oral herpes is not a reflection of personal behavior. Babies, in particular, are at risk of acquiring the virus if kissed by an infected individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain factors can increase the risk of contracting oral herpes, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent kissing of multiple partners</li>
        <li>Sharing food or drinks</li>
        <li>Performing unprotected oral sex, which can transmit HSV-2</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Preventing oral herpes can be difficult due to the virus’s ability to spread even when symptoms are not present. However, using dental dams during oral sex, avoiding contact with open sores, and refraining from kissing someone with an active outbreak can help reduce the spread of the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best approach is to be aware of your own herpes status and communicate openly with others about their status, especially if you’re in close contact through activities like kissing or sharing utensils.
