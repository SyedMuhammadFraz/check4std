      <h2>Understanding Oral Herpes: What You Need to Know</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Oral herpes is commonly referred to as HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus type 1), though it can occur both orally and genitally. Testing for herpes is generally recommended when symptoms are present. The most recognizable symptom of oral herpes is a cold sore, which is generally not a cause for concern. However, doctors are more likely to suggest testing if you’re experiencing an outbreak of genital herpes symptoms.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Types of Testing for Oral Herpes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are several methods to test for herpes, including the following:
      </p>

      <h3>Herpes Viral Culture</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        A herpes viral culture test is conducted only when symptoms are visible, particularly when sores or lesions are present. During the test, a doctor will take a sample of skin cells and fluid from the affected area. Depending on the progression of symptoms, this can involve swabbing or scraping the affected area, which may be uncomfortable. The sample is sent to a laboratory where it is monitored for up to 7 days to check for viral growth. If the virus grows, it confirms the presence of herpes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s ideal to conduct this test within 48 hours after the sore appears. Unfortunately, it has a high rate of false negatives because if the sores are too small or already healing, the results may not be accurate. The short 48-hour window for testing can also be inconvenient.
      </p>

      <h3>Herpes Virus Antigen Detection Test</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        This test works similarly to the herpes viral culture test. It also requires visible symptoms, and sores need to be swabbed. The sample is placed on a microscopic slide to check for herpes virus antigens. In some cases, this test is done in conjunction with the herpes viral culture test.
      </p>

      <h3>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The PCR test involves collecting a sample from an existing sore or lesion. However, this test can also be done using blood or spinal fluid samples, particularly in extreme cases where herpes is suspected to affect the brain or surrounding areas.
      </p>

      <h3>Antibody Test (Blood Test)</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The antibody test is the least invasive method and is the test we recommend. A blood sample is drawn, usually from the arm, without requiring any visual inspection or symptom presence. The blood is then examined for antibodies, which are the body’s response to the herpes virus. This test can be done even when symptoms are not present, as antibodies can remain in your system for life.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Our Herpes Test Works</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        At STDcheck.com, we believe that everyone has the right to know their herpes status, whether or not symptoms are showing. Our process allows you to purchase a herpes antibody blood test without the need for physical inspection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select your test and choose a lab near you.</li>
        <li>Visit the lab at your convenience where a technician will draw a blood sample.</li>
        <li>The lab will analyze the blood for antibodies to the herpes virus.</li>
        <li>Results will be available within 1-2 business days.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested and How Often?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The CDC generally recommends herpes testing only when symptoms are present. Testing is not typically advised for individuals without symptoms because diagnosing genital herpes in asymptomatic individuals does not seem to change sexual behavior or prevent transmission of the virus.
      </p>

      <h3>Incubation Period for Herpes Infection</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        After potential exposure, herpes typically takes 2-12 days (with an average of 4 days) to show symptoms. If you choose to get tested, it’s recommended to wait up to 6 weeks after potential exposure to allow enough time for antibodies to form and ensure an accurate test result, avoiding false negatives.
      </p>

      <h3>Interpreting Herpes Test Results</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Different laboratories may report results in different formats, but you’ll generally see results such as positive, negative, yes, no, or a reference range. If you ever have questions about what your results mean, you can speak with a certified health education specialist.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive/Yes:</strong> You have the herpes virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative/No:</strong> You do not have the herpes virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Abnormal:</strong> Indicates the presence of the herpes virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Indicates the absence of the herpes virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Equivocal/Undetermined:</strong> Your results are unclear and further testing may be needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Reference Range:</strong> Shows the levels of antibodies present in your body. The range may vary by lab, so consult with a professional if you're unsure.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What to Do If You Test Positive for Herpes?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing positive means you have the herpes virus, but it doesn’t indicate whether it’s oral or genital herpes unless symptoms appear in those areas. While there is no cure for herpes, there are treatments to manage the symptoms and reduce outbreaks.
      </p>

      <h3>Herpes Treatment: What Are Your Options?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        While there is no cure for herpes, various treatments can help reduce symptoms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FDA-Approved Antiviral Medications for Genital Herpes:</strong> Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir.</li>
        <li><strong>For Oral Herpes (Cold Sores):</strong> Witch hazel, Peppermint oil, Lemon balm, Licorice powder, Aloe vera gel, Vitamin E and Vitamin C.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What Happens If Herpes is Left Untreated?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In most cases, untreated herpes does not result in any major health complications. The symptoms typically go away on their own, and over time, outbreaks may become less frequent and less severe.
      </p>

      <h3>Can You Get Re-infected and Should You Be Retested?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Once you’ve been infected with herpes, the virus stays in your system for life. However, you won’t get re-infected with the same strain. It’s still possible to contract a different strain of the herpes virus, such as HSV-2 (genital herpes), even after having HSV-1 (oral herpes). Therefore, continued testing for different types of herpes is advisable.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When Can You Resume Sexual Activity?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        According to the CDC, there’s no need to drastically change your sex life after a herpes diagnosis. It’s important to communicate the risks with your partner because there’s always a slight chance of transmitting the virus. If your herpes is oral, avoid kissing or engaging in oral sex when you have an active cold sore (especially if it’s open).
