      <h2>Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is a strain of the herpes simplex virus. Many people associate HSV-1 with "oral herpes," believing that it always leads to cold sores around the mouth or facial area. However, this is not always the case. HSV-1 can also be acquired in the genital area, causing "genital HSV-1." On the other hand, HSV-2 is commonly known as "genital herpes," but it can also be found in the oral region, causing "oral HSV-2." Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are closely related, sharing about 50% of their DNA, and they produce nearly identical symptoms. Therefore, it’s essential to get tested for both strains to accurately determine your infection.

      <br />
      <h3>Where Does HSV-1 Live?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 have preferred locations within the body. HSV-1 typically resides in the back of the neck, leading to outbreaks on the face. In contrast, HSV-2 usually inhabits the base of the spine, resulting in outbreaks in the genital area. However, these preferences are not strict. The virus will establish itself where it was first acquired, and outbreaks will occur in that area.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>How Common is Herpes Simplex Virus 1?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        HSV-1 is very widespread. In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 67% of the global population was infected with this virus, with 140 million people specifically affected by genital HSV-1. Oral HSV-1 is most commonly contracted during childhood through kisses from family members carrying the virus. Both oral and genital HSV-1 cases are increasing.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>How Can You Get HSV-1?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        All herpes strains are highly contagious and can be spread through saliva, sores, and skin-to-skin contact at outbreak sites. The herpes virus can shed, releasing viral traces periodically, even without visible symptoms. This means you can contract the virus even when sores are not present. However, HSV-1 is most contagious during an outbreak, when visible sores are present.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>What is an Initial Herpes Outbreak?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The initial outbreak of HSV-1 is typically more severe than recurring outbreaks. When the virus is first contracted, symptoms may include fever, nausea, headaches, muscle aches, and an overall sense of being unwell, alongside the appearance of fluid-filled lesions or "cold sores." The initial outbreak can occur days, weeks, or even years after first being exposed to the virus.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>What Are the Recurring Symptoms?</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        HSV-1 is a latent and lifelong virus, meaning it remains dormant in the body and can resurface sporadically throughout a person's life. Recurring outbreaks of HSV-1 are usually much milder than the initial episode and primarily consist of fluid-filled blisters or "cold sores." After the blisters rupture, the fluid leaks out, and a yellow scab forms over the broken blister. Once the scab falls off, new skin forms underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
        These lesions typically appear in clusters, either on the face or in the genital region, and can last anywhere from 7 days to 3 weeks. Recurring outbreaks may occur months or even years after the initial infection and can continue intermittently throughout a person’s life. In some cases, they may never occur again, particularly in genital HSV-1 cases. Although outbreaks can be unpredictable, they tend to become less frequent and less severe over time as the body produces more antibodies to combat the virus.

      <h3>HSV-1 Treatment</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Currently, there is no cure for HSV-1. However, the virus can be managed with antiviral medications that help alleviate symptoms and reduce the frequency of outbreaks.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Medication</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The most commonly prescribed antiviral medications for managing HSV-1 and HSV-2 are Acyclovir, Famciclovir, and Valacyclovir. Acyclovir is often the preferred treatment for HSV-1. These medications work by shortening the virus's life cycle, speeding up the healing process of cold sores. Acyclovir can be taken orally or applied topically, though the oral form is more effective. A doctor must prescribe Acyclovir.
