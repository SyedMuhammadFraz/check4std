      <h2>Cold Sores: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cold sores are small, painful, fluid-filled blisters that typically appear in clusters on or around the lips. Also known as fever blisters, cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two main strains of the herpes simplex virus responsible for cold sores: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is most commonly associated with oral cold sores (oral herpes), while HSV-2 is more frequently linked to genital herpes. It’s important to note that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can affect either the oral or genital area. Around 80% of cold sore cases are caused by HSV-1, while the remaining 20% are caused by HSV-2.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Do Cold Sores Look Like and Where Do They Appear?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cold sores typically appear in small clusters and can be identified by their reddish or pinkish irritated appearance. Often referred to as "weepy," cold sores leak fluids when the blisters break and eventually scab over.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sores most commonly appear on or around the lips, but they can also spread to other areas. HSV-1 and HSV-2 can sometimes affect the fingertips (a condition known as herpes whitlow), the eyes (ocular herpes), or widespread areas of skin, particularly in people with eczema.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Get Cold Sores?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cold sores are contracted through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has an active outbreak. Even if the person does not show visible symptoms, the virus can still be transmitted through shared bodily fluids. This means that even if there are no visible blisters, you may still be at risk of contracting the virus. Common ways to get cold sores include kissing, oral sex, and sharing personal items such as toothbrushes, utensils, razors, or towels.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Are Cold Sores Contagious?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cold sores are highly contagious. In fact, it is estimated that about two-thirds of the global population is infected with HSV-1, and approximately 1 in 6 people are infected with HSV-2. If you have cold sores, it’s important to take precautions and avoid direct skin-to-skin contact, particularly with infants, young children, and individuals with weakened immune systems.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Cold Sore Symptoms</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The initial outbreak of cold sores is typically the most severe and may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Painful, eroded gums</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After the first outbreak, symptoms often become less severe but may still include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tingling and itching before the cold sore appears</li>
        <li>Blisters</li>
        <li>Oozing and crusting</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Are Cold Sores Treatable? What Medication Can Be Taken?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although there is no cure for cold sores, they can be managed with suppressive therapy using oral antiviral medications such as Acyclovir, Famciclovir, or Valacyclovir. These medications help reduce the severity and frequency of outbreaks but cannot completely eliminate the virus. Since cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus, they remain a lifelong condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s essential to get tested for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, as these two strains are nearly identical physically, and both can cause cold sores. Our testing service offers a convenient package to test for both strains. A small blood sample is taken by technicians in our CLIA-certified labs, with no need for undressing or uncomfortable swabbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your test result is positive, you can schedule a phone consultation with one of our physicians to discuss next steps and treatment options.
