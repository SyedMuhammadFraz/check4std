      <h2>What Are STDs?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        STDs, or sexually transmitted diseases, are infections commonly spread
        through vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity. However, they can also
        be transmitted through nonsexual means such as intravenous drug use,
        childbirth, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        STDs are quite prevalent. The Centers for Disease Control and
        Prevention (CDC) estimates that 20 million new cases of STDs occur each
        year in the United States. Worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO)
        reports more than 1 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections
        (STIs) every day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While many STDs don't show symptoms, they can still lead to irreversible
        damage if left untreated. Despite the fear they may cause, most STDs are
        treatable, especially if diagnosed early.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Most Common STDs</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Chlamydia</h3>
      <p>
        Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that can be cured with antibiotics.
        It is the most frequently reported notifiable disease in the United
        States. Many people do not show symptoms, which means they may not get
        tested. If left untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
        and infertility.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Gonorrhea</h3>
      <p>
        Gonorrhea is another bacterial infection that is treatable with
        antibiotics. It affects the urethra, rectum, throat, and genital tract.
        Although gonorrhea can go unnoticed without symptoms, it is still
        contagious. Gonorrhea and chlamydia often occur together in co-infections.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Syphilis</h3>
      <p>
        Syphilis is a bacterial infection that progresses through four stages:
        primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. In its early stages, it is
        difficult to detect, but it can lead to severe organ damage, including
        brain damage, if left untreated.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>HPV (Human Papillomavirus)</h3>
      <p>
        HPV is the most common STD. It is estimated that almost everyone who is
        sexually active will contract at least one type of HPV during their lifetime.
        There are over 100 different strains, most of which the body can clear on
        its own. However, certain "high-risk" strains can cause genital warts or
        lead to cancer. Vaccines are available to prevent the most dangerous strains.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Herpes</h3>
      <p>
        Herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is commonly
        associated with cold sores on the mouth or genital area. HSV spreads through
        skin-to-skin contact and infected bodily fluids. The virus remains in the
        body and can be managed with antiviral medications, though there is no cure.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Hepatitis</h3>
      <p>
        Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis A is contracted
        through contaminated food or water, while Hepatitis B and C are spread
        through infected bodily fluids. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B,
        while hepatitis C can be managed with antiviral treatment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)</h3>
      <p>
        HIV weakens the immune system and makes the body more vulnerable to other
        infections and serious illnesses. It is a lifelong condition, but with
        antiretroviral therapy (ART), it can be managed. If left untreated, HIV can
        progress to AIDS, a life-threatening stage of the disease.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Trichomoniasis</h3>
      <p>
        Trichomoniasis is a parasitic infection and the most common curable STD
        in the world. It is primarily spread through vaginal sex, and although
        it often shows no symptoms, it can cause foul-smelling discharge and
        painful urination in some people. It is treatable with medication.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>STD Symptoms</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The majority of STDs do not display obvious symptoms. Even if symptoms
        do appear, they are often similar across different STDs, which makes it
        difficult to diagnose based on symptoms alone. The only way to get an
        accurate diagnosis is through testing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Symptoms in Men</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Painful urination</li>
        <li>Itching or burning sensation on the penis</li>
        <li>Penile discharge</li>
        <li>Bumps or blisters around the penis</li>
        <li>Painful ejaculation</li>
        <li>Swollen or tender testicles</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Anal warts</li>
        <li>Rectal bleeding or discharge</li>
        <li>No symptoms at all</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>Symptoms in Women</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Vaginal itching, burning, or discomfort</li>
        <li>Unusual vaginal discharge</li>
        <li>Genital blisters</li>
        <li>Painful intercourse</li>
        <li>Rash in the genital region</li>
        <li>Painful urination</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Anal warts</li>
        <li>Rectal bleeding or discharge</li>
        <li>No symptoms at all</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>Risk Factors for STDs</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone who is sexually active can contract an STD, but some factors can
        increase the risk of transmission:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unprotected sex</li>
        <li>Multiple sexual partners</li>
        <li>Having a previous STD</li>
        <li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
        <li>Injecting drugs with shared needles</li>
        <li>Age (15â€“24 years old)</li>
        <li>Engaging in anal sex</li>
        <li>Certain occupations (e.g., healthcare or sex work)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h2>Are STDs Curable?</h2>
      <p>
        Some STDs are treatable and can be cured with antibiotics, such as:
        chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Other STDs, like
        HPV and hepatitis, may resolve on their own or can be prevented with
        vaccines. However, lifelong conditions like herpes and HIV can only
        be managed with ongoing treatment.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        While abstinence is the only 100% effective method for preventing STDs,
        there are other steps you can take to reduce your risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use protection (condoms and dental dams)</li>
        <li>Get vaccinated (e.g., for HPV and hepatitis)</li>
        <li>Limit the number of sexual partners</li>
        <li>Communicate openly with sexual partners about testing and STD status</li>
        <li>Consider PrEP for HIV prevention</li>
        <li>Avoid substance abuse that can lead to risky behaviors</li>
        <li>Get tested regularly</li>
      </ul>
    </>
