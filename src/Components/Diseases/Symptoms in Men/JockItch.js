      <h2>What is Jock Itch?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jock itch (also known as tinea cruris) is a fungal infection that typically
        occurs when sweat-soaked clothing is worn for extended periods. Fungus thrives
        in damp, warm areas with limited light, making the groin an ideal place for
        this infection to develop. Jock itch is a form of ringworm found in the groin
        and on the thighs, unlike tinea corporis, which is ringworm found on other parts
        of the body. Despite the name, ringworm is not caused by worms, but by fungi.

      <h2>Who is at Risk for Jock Itch?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jock itch commonly affects athletes, though anyone can get it. Individuals at
        higher risk are those who wear tight, sweat-laden clothing that prevents moisture
        from evaporating, as well as obese individuals, as sweat accumulates in skinfolds,
        making it difficult for moisture to escape.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Symptoms of Jock Itch</h2>
      <br />
      <p>The symptoms of jock itch include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red or reddish-brown rash</li>
        <li>Itching</li>
        <li>Skin peeling or flaking</li>
        <li>Discolored skin</li>
        <li>Burning sensation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These symptoms typically worsen with activity. The infection often affects the
        groin, thighs, and lower abdomen, but rarely extends to the testicles.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Is Jock Itch Sexually Transmitted?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jock itch can be mildly contagious, particularly through direct skin-to-skin
        contact (such as during sex) or by sharing contaminated clothing. However, it cannot
        be transmitted through casual contact, such as a high five. The infection requires
        prolonged contact in moist, dark environments for the fungus to thrive.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Jock Itch vs. Herpes</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        An itching groin area accompanied by a red rash with peeling and blistering may
        lead some to confuse jock itch with genital herpes. Jock itch typically forms a rash
        with small blisters along its edges, while herpes blisters are larger, fluid-filled,
        and typically don’t come with a rash. Herpes blisters burst, crust over, and become
        painful sores, unlike jock itch. A doctor can help distinguish between the two.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Jock Itch Blisters</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Blisters from jock itch are small, fluid-filled pockets that may be red, white,
        or clear. They often accompany the typical symptoms of jock itch, such as redness,
        itching, and burning. While not everyone with jock itch will develop blisters, if
        they do, it’s important to seek medical advice for confirmation and appropriate
        treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jock itch blisters are caused by dermatophytes, fungi that thrive in moist, warm
        environments, such as the groin and inner thighs. The condition can spread through
        direct skin contact, sharing towels, or coming into contact with contaminated
        surfaces. Though jock itch blisters are common, they are not serious and can be
        treated effectively.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treatment for Jock Itch</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jock itch can be treated with over-the-counter antifungal creams, powders, or
        lotions. It typically takes 2 to 4 weeks for the iFnfection to clear. It's important
        to sanitize athletic gear such as towels, jock straps, and cups. In severe cases,
        a doctor may prescribe oral antifungal medications.
