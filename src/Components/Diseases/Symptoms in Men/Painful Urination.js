      <h2>What is Painful Urination (Dysuria)?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Painful urination, or dysuria, refers to a sensation of pain, discomfort, or
        burning while urinating. This pain can occur at any point in the urinary tract,
        such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. It is often felt when urine
        comes into contact with internal sores or lesions. The discomfort may be constant
        or may happen intermittently, often triggered by external irritants such as during
        sexual intercourse or when clothes or other objects come into contact with the area.
        Burning may start suddenly or increase gradually over time.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Non-Sexual Causes of Painful Urination</h2>
      <br />
      <p>The following conditions can cause painful urination without being related to sexual activity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allergic reactions to soaps, detergents, or clothing that come in contact with the genitals.</li>
        <li>Bladder stones – Small mineral masses that form in the bladder.</li>
        <li>Bladder cancer – Malignant cells in the bladder may cause blood in the urine and painful urination.</li>
        <li>Cystitis – Inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI).</li>
        <li>Urinary tract infection (UTI) – UTIs are caused by harmful bacteria entering the urinary tract, and painful urination is a common symptom.</li>
        <li>Medications – Some medications may cause cystitis as a side effect.</li>
        <li>Irritation from condoms or lubricants.</li>
        <li>Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) – A type of UTI that can cause painful urination and needs quick treatment.</li>
        <li>Kidney stones – Hard deposits of minerals and salts in the kidneys, causing pain and dysuria.</li>
        <li>Prostatitis – Inflammation of the prostate, leading to painful urination in men.</li>
        <li>Urethral stricture – Narrowing of the urethra, often due to inflammation or injury.</li>
        <li>Urethritis – Inflammation of the urethra.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Painful Urination Caused by STDs</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like gonorrhea and chlamydia are
        often associated with painful urination. Chlamydia frequently occurs alongside
        gonorrhea, leading to a co-infection. Both infections can be treated with antibiotics,
        often in a single dose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other STDs that can cause dysuria include genital herpes, ureaplasma, and trichomoniasis.
        While bacteria causing UTIs can sometimes be sexually transmitted, urinary tract infections
        are generally not classified as STDs.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>STDs That Can Cause Painful Urination:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chlamydia – A bacterial STD that can lead to painful urination and discharge from the penis.</li>
        <li>Gonorrhea – Another bacterial STD that causes penile discharge and painful urination.</li>
        <li>Mycoplasma genitalium – A bacterial STI that affects the urinary tract, leading to urethritis and discharge from the penis.</li>
        <li>Genital herpes – Herpes lesions or sores can cause burning pain when urinating if they come into contact with urine.</li>
        <li>Ureaplasma – A bacterial STI that can cause painful urination and discharge.</li>
        <li>Trichomoniasis – An STD that can cause an irritated sensation, burning during urination, and discharge.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Differences in Dysuria in Men vs. Women</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anatomical differences between men and women contribute to variations in the causes
        and effects of dysuria. Women are more likely to develop urinary tract infections
        because of their shorter urethras, which makes it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder.
        Also, women may find it more difficult to notice symptoms like discharge, which is common
        in some STDs.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Causes of Painful Urination in Men</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        For men, dysuria is often caused by prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate),
        sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Causes of Painful Urination in Women</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        For women, painful urination can be a sign of an infection, such as a UTI or
        sexually transmitted infection. It can also be caused by bladder stones, irritation
        from activities like long bike rides, or hormonal changes during menopause.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Diagnosing Dysuria</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        To diagnose the cause of painful urination, doctors may ask about your symptoms
        and sexual history. Tests like urinalysis or STD tests may be ordered. If you believe
        your dysuria is due to an STD, you can opt for a convenient home test. If the result is
        positive, healthcare providers can offer consultation and prescriptions.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treatment for Painful Urination</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Treatment for dysuria depends on the cause. Since dysuria is often due to bacterial
        infections, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. STDs that cause painful urination,
        like chlamydia and gonorrhea, can also be treated with antibiotics. Testing for STDs
        is the best way to determine the cause and guide treatment. Regular testing is important
        for those who are sexually active.
