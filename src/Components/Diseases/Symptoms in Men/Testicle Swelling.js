      <h1>What is Testicle Swelling?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testicle swelling is an enlargement of one or both testicles. You may
        notice swelling when there is local inflammation of the testicle
        specifically, or more general swelling of the scrotum (the pouch of
        skin which holds the testicles), and the other structures inside.
        Testicle swelling or scrotal swelling can be caused by injury or
        various medical conditions and diseases, including fluid buildup and
        infections like sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Swollen Testicles</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testicle swelling can develop quickly or over time. It can be painless,
        or it can occur with different levels of testicular pain and other
        symptoms. If you have testicular swelling along with pain that is
        sudden and severe, you should seek immediate medical attention because
        it may be a sign of testicular torsion, a medical emergency that can
        cause serious damage or even loss of the affected testicle.
      </p>

      <h3>Symptoms that may accompany swollen testicles include:</h3>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Swelling, redness, and tenderness of the testicles and scrotum</li>
        <li>Abdominal or groin pain</li>
        <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Painful urination</li>
        <li>Penile discharge</li>
        <li>Pain during sexual intercourse or ejaculation</li>
        <li>Blood in the urine or semen</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can STD Cause Swelling on Testicles?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Causes of swollen testicles include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Infection:</strong> Orchitis (inflammation of the testicle)
          can be caused by bacterial and viral diseases such as the STDs
          chlamydia and gonorrhea, and the mumps virus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Epididymitis:</strong> An inflammation of the epididymis, the
          tube that stores sperm and connects the testicles to the vas
          deferens. Epididymitis can also be caused by STDs and infection, and
          can lead to swelling in the testicles (epididymo-orchitis).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trauma:</strong> Because the testicles hang from the body,
          they are vulnerable to harm, which can lead to swelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testicular torsion:</strong> When a testicle twists inside the
          scrotum, twisting the spermatic cord that carries blood to it and
          interrupting blood flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hydrocele:</strong> When fluid builds up in the scrotum,
          which can cause the scrotum to feel heavy, like a water-filled
          balloon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Varicocele:</strong> A lumpy area caused by swollen veins in
          the testicles, often described as “a bag of worms.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spermatocele:</strong> Spermatic cysts are fluid-filled and
          often painless and benign (non-cancerous).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inguinal hernia:</strong> When fatty tissue or a part of your
          bowel pokes through a weakness in the abdominal wall muscles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Congestive heart failure:</strong> When your heart’s pumping
          power is inadequate to meet your body’s needs, which can result in
          fluid buildup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testicular cancer:</strong> The most common sign is a
          painless lump in the testicle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Should You Be Concerned?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In general, if you notice swelling in your testicles and it worries
        you, it’s a good idea to get a physical examination by a doctor and get
        tested accordingly. If the swelling doesn’t go away or if it is
        uncomfortable or painful, it can be a sign that you have something that
        may require medical attention. Even if you feel no pain, it can still
        be an issue.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        To determine the root of testicular swelling, a doctor examines your
        testicles for size and positioning, and checks for swelling and
        tenderness. They may shine a light (transillumination) to check for
        solid masses, which block light, unlike fluid-filled masses.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Treatment of testicle swelling or scrotal swelling depends on the
        underlying cause. While certain conditions that cause testicle swelling
        may not require treatment, others call for extensive treatment.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Ignoring testicular swelling can lead to health complications. Depending
        on the cause, untreated swollen testicles could impact your ability to
        make normal levels of testosterone, or lower fertility.
