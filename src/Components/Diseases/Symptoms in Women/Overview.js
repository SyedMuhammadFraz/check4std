When symptoms do occur, they can be vague, making it difficult to identify the underlying cause without testing. Common symptoms like discharge, odor, or itching may be confused with other conditions such as urinary tract infections or yeast infections. Early testing is essential for a proper diagnosis and treatment to prevent long-term health issues.</p>
