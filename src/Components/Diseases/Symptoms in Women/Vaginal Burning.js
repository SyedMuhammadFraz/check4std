      <h2>What Is Vaginal Burning and Painful Urination?</h2>
      <p>
        Vaginal burning is an abnormal burning or stinging irritation that
        sometimes occurs during urination. The stinging or burning during
        urination is usually caused when urine comes in contact with vaginal
        lesions or areas of the genital region, such as the vulva or labia, that
        are inflamed. Vaginal burning or painful urination can also be signs of
        an STD and are often the first noticeable sign that an infection is
        present.

      <br />
      <h3>Causes of Vaginal Burning or Painful Urination</h3>
      <p>
        Vaginal burning or painful urination can occur due to several causes.
        Some of them may not be sexually transmitted and include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Yeast infection or urinary tract infection (UTI)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bacterial vaginosis (BV)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Chemical irritation from douches or creams</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Irritation from condoms and other contraceptives/lubricants</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Allergic reaction to soaps, detergents, or feminine products</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Friction from toilet paper</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <p>
        Vaginal burning or a burning feeling when you urinate can be a constant
        irritation or can occur intermittently when irritants are introduced to
        the vaginal region (such as during intercourse or when clothing or other
        objects come in contact with the area). Burning can begin suddenly or
        gradually grow in intensity over a period of time. In some cases, vaginal
        burning goes away on its own, but in cases where the burning is caused
        by an STD, medication is required to treat the burning.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Internal Burning or Painful Sensation During Urination</h3>
      <p>
        An internal burning or painful sensation during urination is usually a
        sign of a bladder or urinary tract infection or an allergic reaction.
        Non-sexual causes are the same as external burning but can also include
        trauma to the vagina. In rare cases, an allergic reaction to semen can
        cause internal vaginal burning.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Which STDs Cause Vaginal Burning?</h3>
      <p>
        Several STDs can cause vaginal burning. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Herpes Simplex 2 (HSV-2)</strong>: Known as genital herpes, HSV-2 is the most common STD associated with vaginal burning. An outbreak of genital herpes causes clusters of small, painful bumps that eventually burst and ooze a clear fluid. While most outbreaks include bumps on the external vaginal area, lesions can also form inside the vagina, causing a burning pain during intercourse or tampon insertion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trichomoniasis</strong>: Caused by a protozoan parasite, trichomoniasis can cause irritation and inflammation of the vaginal skin, leading to vaginal burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gonorrhea and Chlamydia</strong>: These bacterial STDs are both associated with vaginal burning. Chlamydia is the most commonly occurring STD among women and often occurs alongside gonorrhea in what is called a “co-infection.” Both infections can be cured with antibiotics, often in a single dose.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h3>Testing and Diagnosis</h3>
      <p>
        Getting tested for STDs is the only way to be sure of the cause of vaginal
        burning, irritation, or a burning sensation while urinating. Many STDs do
        not show symptoms, so an infection could go unnoticed and progress into a
        more serious condition with long-lasting side effects. Frequent STD testing
        is the only way for sexually active women to be completely sure of their
        STD status and prevent untreated infections.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
      <p>
        If vaginal burning persists or is accompanied by other symptoms such as
        unusual discharge, pain during intercourse, or fever, it’s important to
        consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
