      <h2>Understanding Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Engaging in sexual activities—whether oral, vaginal, or anal—can lead to
        sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These infections are highly prevalent.
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), millions of
        new cases occur annually in the United States, many of which remain undiagnosed.
      </p>
      <p>
        STDs often go unnoticed because they may not produce clear symptoms. Many
        individuals show no signs at all and may unknowingly carry the infection for
        years. When symptoms do appear, they can range from mild to severe and are
        sometimes mistaken for other health issues. Regular testing is essential for
        those who are sexually active.
      </p>
      <p>
        STDs can affect various parts of the body beyond the genitals, such as the mouth,
        throat, upper thighs, anus, and even the eyes.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms of STDs</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Symptoms of STDs vary based on the type of infection and may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No noticeable symptoms</li>
        <li>Bumps, sores, or warts around the mouth, genitals, or anus</li>
        <li>Skin rash</li>
        <li>Painful urination</li>
        <li>Itching, burning, or irritation near the genital area</li>
        <li>Vaginal discharge in women</li>
        <li>Penile discharge in men</li>
        <li>Rectal discharge, bleeding, or pain</li>
        <li>Vaginal odor</li>
        <li>Redness or swelling near the genitals</li>
        <li>Swollen or painful testicles in men</li>
        <li>Discomfort during sex</li>
        <li>Lower abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches)</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Night sweats</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Yellowing of the skin (jaundice)</li>
        <li>Pink eye or red, swollen eyes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even without noticeable symptoms, untreated STDs can lead to severe health
        complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and organ
        damage. Some STDs, like HIV, can be life-threatening. Additionally, untreated
        STDs pose risks to unborn babies during pregnancy and increase susceptibility to
        other infections.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Asymptomatic STDs</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many STDs are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause noticeable symptoms but can
        still be transmitted to others. These infections spread through contact with
        bodily fluids like semen, vaginal secretions, or blood, as well as through mucous
        membranes and infected skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using protective measures such as condoms and dental dams during sexual activity
        and undergoing regular testing are vital for preventing and identifying infections
        early.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Common STDs and Their Symptoms</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>Chlamydia</h3>
      <p>
        Chlamydia is a common bacterial infection that can affect the genitals, mouth,
        throat, anus, and eyes. Many infected individuals experience no symptoms or mild
        signs that are easy to overlook. Untreated chlamydia can harm the reproductive
        system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain or burning during urination</li>
        <li>Vaginal or penile discharge</li>
        <li>Painful intercourse (in women)</li>
        <li>Bleeding between menstrual periods</li>
        <li>Swollen or painful testicles (less common)</li>
        <li>Rectal pain, discharge, or bleeding</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Gonorrhea</h3>
      <p>
        Gonorrhea, also known as "the clap" or "the drip," is a bacterial infection
        affecting the genitals, mouth, throat, eyes, and anus. Symptoms may appear within
        two weeks of infection but are absent in many cases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain or burning during urination</li>
        <li>Abnormal vaginal discharge</li>
        <li>White, yellow, or green discharge from the penis</li>
        <li>Swollen or painful testicles (less common)</li>
        <li>Rectal pain, bleeding, or discharge</li>
        <li>Painful bowel movements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Coinfections with chlamydia are common.</p>

      <h3>Herpes</h3>
      <p>
        The herpes simplex virus (HSV) can infect the mouth (oral herpes) or genitals
        (genital herpes), causing outbreaks of painful sores. Many individuals with
        herpes are unaware of their infection due to mild or absent symptoms.
      </p>
      <h4>Symptoms of Oral Herpes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Tingling, burning, or itching before blisters appear</li>
        <li>Cold sores or blisters around the mouth</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Symptoms of Genital Herpes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pain, burning, or itching before blisters form</li>
        <li>Small red bumps, white blisters, or ulcers on or near the genitals and anus</li>
        <li>Flu-like symptoms (fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches)</li>
        <li>Pain during urination</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Herpes outbreaks may recur after the initial infection.</p>

      <h3>HIV</h3>
      <p>
        HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) weakens the immune system, making the body
        more susceptible to infections. Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, a
        life-threatening condition.
      </p>
      <h4>Early Symptoms of HIV:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Rash</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the infection progresses, chronic symptoms such as weight loss, diarrhea, and
        persistent fever may appear. AIDS symptoms include severe fatigue, chronic
        infections, and neurological issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Syphilis</h3>
      <p>
        Syphilis is a bacterial infection with distinct stages: primary, secondary,
        latent, and tertiary. It can cause severe damage to various organs if untreated.
      </p>
      <h4>Stages and Symptoms:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Stage:</strong> Painless sores (chancres) appear where the
          bacteria entered the body. These heal within weeks but remain infectious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secondary Stage:</strong> Symptoms include skin rashes, sores, fever,
          and swollen lymph nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Latent Stage:</strong> Symptoms may disappear, but the infection
          remains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tertiary Stage:</strong> Severe complications such as paralysis,
          blindness, and organ damage occur.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>Prevention and Testing</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Regular testing, safe sexual practices, and prompt treatment are crucial to
        preventing the spread of STDs and managing their effects on health.
