      <h2>What is Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is primarily transmitted through sexual contact with an infected individual, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Although syphilis was once a significant public health threat, its impact has lessened with the discovery of effective treatments. If untreated, syphilis can progress through various stages and cause severe damage to organs, including the brain and heart.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Is Syphilis Curable?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, syphilis is treatable and curable with antibiotics. The specific treatment depends on the stage of the disease, as well as how long a person has been infected. Syphilis progresses in three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Syphilis:</strong> A painless sore (chancre) appears at the site of infection, typically on the genitals, anus, or mouth. The chancre heals within 3-6 weeks, even without treatment, but the infection remains in the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secondary Syphilis:</strong> This stage occurs after the chancre heals and can involve symptoms such as skin rashes, fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle aches. These symptoms may resolve on their own but can return later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tertiary Syphilis:</strong> In advanced syphilis, untreated infection can cause serious damage to organs, including the heart and brain, leading to complications like strokes, blindness, and even death.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Penicillin G benzathine is commonly used for primary and secondary syphilis, while more severe cases, especially those involving organ damage, may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. However, it's important to note that while antibiotics can cure syphilis, they cannot reverse damage to organs caused by advanced infection. Early treatment is essential to prevent long-term health issues.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Are Syphilis Symptoms?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis develops in stages, with each stage having different symptoms. However, it can often go unnoticed, especially in the early stages when sores or symptoms may be hidden.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Syphilis:</strong> A painless sore (chancre) appears at the site of infection, usually within 10 to 90 days after exposure. The sore may heal without treatment in 3-6 weeks, but the infection remains in the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secondary Syphilis:</strong> Skin rashes (often not itchy), lesions, fever, swollen glands, weight loss, hair loss, sore throat, headaches, muscle aches, and fatigue. Symptoms may resolve on their own but can recur without treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Latent Syphilis:</strong> No visible symptoms for years, although the infection remains in the body. The person is still contagious during the early latent stage, even if no symptoms are present.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tertiary Syphilis:</strong> Large sores called gummata, affecting skin and organs. Serious health issues, such as strokes, numbness, heart problems, and vision loss.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Get Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person's syphilitic sore, or chancre, during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. It is contagious during the primary and secondary stages, and sometimes during the early latent period, even without visible symptoms. Syphilis can also be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, resulting in congenital syphilis, which can lead to stillbirth or infant death.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Is At Risk?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who is sexually active can contract syphilis, but certain groups are at higher risk, including individuals who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engage in unprotected sex.</li>
        <li>Have multiple sexual partners.</li>
        <li>Are men who have sex with men (MSM).</li>
        <li>Have HIV.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The CDC recommends that all pregnant women get tested for syphilis during their first prenatal visit to prevent congenital syphilis.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Prevent Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The most effective way to prevent syphilis is through abstinence, but safer sex practices can significantly reduce risk. Using latex condoms or dental dams during sexual activities helps prevent exposure to sores. However, areas not covered by condoms may still transmit the infection if sores are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limiting sexual partners and maintaining a monogamous relationship with a tested, syphilis-free partner can reduce the risk. Regular STD testing is essential for early detection and treatment.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Syphilis in the U.S.</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis cases have been on the rise in the United States. In 2018, the CDC reported over 115,000 syphilis cases, a 14% increase from the previous year. The rise in cases is linked to several factors, such as changes in sexual behaviors, reduced condom use, and decreased access to healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        To combat this, public health efforts must focus on improving access to testing and treatment, promoting safe sex, reducing stigma, and increasing public awareness about syphilis and other STDs.
