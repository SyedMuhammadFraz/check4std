      <h2>Syphilis Overview</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis is a bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) that progresses through four stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. The symptoms you experience depend on which stage the infection is in. Syphilis can be deceptive; its stages sometimes overlap, and its symptoms may not always appear in the typical sequence. In some cases, a person with syphilis may not show any symptoms for years, making it even harder to detect.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Why Syphilis is Hard to Detect</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Symptoms of syphilis can be mild, painless, or hidden inside the body, making them easy to miss. This means they may be overlooked or mistaken for less serious conditions. Syphilis is often referred to as the "great imitator" because its symptoms resemble those of other infections and diseases. If left untreated, syphilis can cause serious damage to several body systems, leading to life-threatening health problems such as heart disease, mental health disorders, nervous system damage, blindness, and even aortic aneurysms.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Syphilis Symptoms and Signs</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many individuals with syphilis are unaware of their infection. You or your sexual partner may not experience symptoms, or the symptoms might be invisible or mistaken for something else. The syphilitic sores (chancres) can be hidden in hard-to-see areas such as under the foreskin, inside the vagina, or on the rectum. The signs may be mild and can easily be confused with common rashes or pimples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Syphilis is most contagious during the primary and secondary stages, but the symptoms can be present in any stage.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Primary Stage Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The first sign of syphilis is typically a painless sore called a chancre, which appears at the site where the bacteria entered the body, such as on the genitals, anus, lips, or mouth. Chancres are usually firm, round, and may be open or wet. While often just one sore appears, multiple sores can develop. Chancres are highly contagious and can spread the syphilis bacteria during sexual contact.
      </p>
      <p>
        A chancre will generally heal on its own within 3 to 5 weeks. However, the syphilis bacteria remains in the body unless treated, which can lead to the progression of the infection to the next stage.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Secondary Stage Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        During the secondary stage, you may experience skin rashes and/or sores in mucous membranes (such as the mouth, vagina, or anus). These rashes may appear while the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has healed. The rashes are usually not itchy and may be so mild that you don't notice them. Lesions and rashes are contagious when touched.
      </p>
      <p>Symptoms of secondary syphilis include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rough, red, or reddish-brown spots on the palms of your hands and/or the soles of your feet</li>
        <li>Sores in the mouth, vagina, and/or anus</li>
        <li>Swollen lymph glands</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Hair loss</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These symptoms eventually disappear, but without treatment, the infection will progress to the latent or tertiary stage.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Latent Stage</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The latent stage occurs after the secondary rash fades. During this stage, there are no symptoms, but syphilis is still present in the body. The latent stage can last from 1 to 20 years, with some people remaining unaware of their infection. In fact, around 20-30% of people with syphilis may relapse into the secondary stage during the latent period, meaning they may experience symptoms again after a period of no symptoms.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Tertiary Stage Symptoms</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        About one-third of untreated individuals will progress to tertiary syphilis, which is the most severe and destructive stage. Tertiary syphilis can cause serious damage to internal organs and even be fatal. This stage typically occurs 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, and it can cause debilitating health problems such as tumors, nerve damage, and brain dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>Symptoms of tertiary syphilis include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage to organs like the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints</li>
        <li>Chest pain or difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>Behavior changes</li>
        <li>Dementia (mental disorders)</li>
        <li>Vision problems or blindness</li>
        <li>Loss of muscle coordination</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Numbness</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h2>What Happens if Syphilis Is Left Untreated?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If untreated, syphilis can spread to multiple organ systems and cause potentially life-threatening complications. The damage can affect the brain, nervous system, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. The impact depends on which organs are affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Syphilis is easily curable in the early stages with antibiotics, and treatment will stop the progression of the disease. However, if left untreated, even though the infection can be cured in later stages, some of the damage caused may not be reversible. Therefore, it’s critical to get tested early.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Neurosyphilis and Ocular Syphilis</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        When syphilis affects the brain or nervous system, it leads to a condition called neurosyphilis. When it impacts the eyes, it’s known as ocular syphilis. Both conditions can occur at any stage of the infection. Neurosyphilis can lead to headaches, difficulty with muscle control, paralysis, behavioral changes, loss of senses, and dementia. Ocular syphilis can cause partial or complete vision loss.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Syphilis and HIV Risk</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Having open sores caused by syphilis increases the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV and other STIs. This is because broken skin allows infections to enter or leave the body more easily. Studies show that about half of American men who have sex with men and are diagnosed with primary and secondary syphilis are also living with HIV.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Syphilis and Pregnancy</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis can be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. This can lead to severe health problems for the fetus or newborn. Congenital syphilis may cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or death shortly after birth. Babies born with congenital syphilis may suffer from deformed bones, severe anemia, brain and nerve issues, enlarged organs, and skin rashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are pregnant and have syphilis, treatment with antibiotics can reduce the risk of passing the infection to your baby. It's important to avoid breastfeeding if there are syphilis sores on the breast or nipple.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you suspect you have syphilis or believe you may have been exposed, it is crucial to get tested. Early detection and treatment can prevent the serious health consequences of syphilis. Getting tested regularly and practicing safe sex are essential steps in protecting your health.
