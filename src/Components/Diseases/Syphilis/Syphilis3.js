      <h2>Syphilis: A Common Bacterial STD</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis is a prevalent sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by bacteria. In its early stages, syphilis can be treated effectively with antibiotics. However, if left untreated, it can lead to serious health complications.
        Getting tested for syphilis is crucial for early detection. Fortunately, the process is quick, easy, and can help prevent the severe consequences of untreated syphilis, such as blindness and paralysis.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Do You Test for Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing for syphilis is simple, confidential, and available at nationwide testing centers. Our FDA-cleared Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) syphilis test is a blood test that can detect the presence of syphilis antibodies as soon as 3-6 weeks after exposure. If the test result is positive, a follow-up Treponemal Pallidum Assay (TPA) is conducted to confirm the presence of the syphilis-causing bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the thought of testing may seem daunting, it is a painless and routine procedure. After ordering the test, you can visit a lab at your convenience—no appointment or ID required. The blood draw is simple and quick, and most results are available within 1-2 business days, which you can access by logging into your online account.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Who Should Get Tested for Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who is sexually active can contract syphilis through oral, vaginal, and anal sex, or through sexual contact with someone infected. Syphilis is transmitted through contact with sores, known as chancres, that can appear in, on, or around the genitals, and sometimes other parts of the body. These sores are often hard to detect, and sometimes only one chancre forms, making the infection easy to overlook.
      </p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends syphilis testing for individuals who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exhibit symptoms of syphilis</li>
        <li>Have had sex with someone diagnosed with syphilis</li>
        <li>Are pregnant</li>
        <li>Are men who have sex with men (MSM)</li>
        <li>Are living with HIV</li>
        <li>Are on PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV prevention</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since syphilis often has mild or no symptoms, it's impossible to tell if you have it just by feeling. Whether or not you notice sores or other symptoms, getting tested is the best way to ensure you remain healthy and to get treatment as soon as possible. If left untreated, syphilis can cause severe health issues, including damage to the heart, blood vessels, bones, and brain.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Diagnosis & Test Results</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Negative result:</strong> No antibodies detected, meaning either you don’t have the infection or the test was taken too early (before antibodies have developed).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive result:</strong> Indicates a likely infection. A second test confirms the presence of syphilis bacteria.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Should You Do If You Test Positive?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Testing positive for syphilis can be unsettling, but it’s important to stay calm. Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics in the early stages. It’s also crucial to inform your sexual partner(s) so they can get tested and treated as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you test positive for syphilis through our services, our doctors are available for consultation. While we don’t provide treatment directly, they will guide you on how to proceed and help you understand your results. A shot of antibiotics (typically penicillin) is the standard treatment. For your convenience, you can download or print your test results to share with a healthcare provider for treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CDC recommends that all individuals with primary and secondary syphilis be tested for HIV, as syphilis increases the risk of contracting HIV. We offer a 10% discount for returning customers to help you maintain your sexual health.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How Is Syphilis Treated?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin, unless you have an allergy or other contraindications. Early-stage syphilis (primary, secondary, or early latent) can be cured with a single shot of penicillin. For longer-term infections, multiple shots may be needed. Our doctors recommend follow-up testing to confirm that the infection has been fully cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s essential to seek treatment as soon as possible. While antibiotics can eliminate the syphilis bacteria and prevent further harm, they cannot reverse any damage already done to the body.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What to Expect During Syphilis Treatment</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        After treatment, it’s common to experience mild side effects, particularly in the first 24 hours, especially for early-stage syphilis. These may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Chills</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These symptoms are part of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, a common response when large numbers of bacteria are killed off by antibiotics. Don’t be alarmed—these effects usually subside within a day or so. If symptoms persist, it’s recommended to consult a healthcare provider.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Can You Get Re-Infected?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, once you’ve had syphilis, you’re not immune to future infections. Exposure to syphilis again could result in re-infection. Even if your partner shows no symptoms, they could still be carrying the bacteria. For this reason, using condoms during sex is crucial. However, syphilis sores can appear in areas not covered by condoms, meaning they’re not 100% protective.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve been exposed to syphilis again, it’s recommended to get retested.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When Can You Have Sex Again?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It’s best to wait at least 7 days after completing your syphilis treatment before engaging in sexual activity. To avoid spreading syphilis during treatment, avoid sex altogether. While condoms offer some protection, syphilis can still be transmitted if sores are not covered. To prevent reinfection, ensure your partner(s) have completed treatment as well.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Treating Syphilis During Pregnancy</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pregnant women with syphilis should be treated with an injection of penicillin, just like non-pregnant individuals. The treatment regimen may vary depending on how long the woman has been infected and how far along she is in her pregnancy. The CDC recommends penicillin G, as it’s the only effective treatment to prevent syphilis transmission from mother to baby and to treat any fetal infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a second injection may be necessary, especially for women with more advanced stages of syphilis. If you’re allergic to penicillin, your provider may recommend penicillin desensitization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment is critical for pregnant women, as congenital syphilis can result in severe complications, including stillbirth, premature birth, and serious organ damage to the baby. Early screening is essential for all pregnant women, and those at higher risk should be screened again in the third trimester and at delivery.
