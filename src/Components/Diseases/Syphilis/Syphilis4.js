      <h2>RPR Test</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test is a straightforward blood test used to detect a syphilis infection. Syphilis is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, which is primarily transmitted through sexual contact. The RPR test identifies antibodies produced by the body in response to a syphilis infection. Along with specific antibody testing, the RPR test helps confirm the presence of an active syphilis infection, so you can know for sure if you have it and seek treatment for a swift recovery.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Reasons to Get Tested</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The RPR test is primarily used as a screening tool for syphilis. It may be recommended if you show symptoms such as a skin rash or sores. There are several other scenarios where an RPR test may be necessary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are at risk of being exposed to syphilis.</li>
        <li>You have another sexually transmitted disease (STD) or an HIV infection.</li>
        <li>You have a sexual partner diagnosed with syphilis.</li>
        <li>You are a man who has sex with men (MSM).</li>
        <li>You’ve engaged in high-risk sexual activity.</li>
        <li>You are pregnant, to ensure no active infection that could affect your baby.</li>
        <li>You’ve been treated for syphilis, to confirm the infection has been fully cured.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If left undetected and untreated, syphilis can lead to severe health complications. Over time, it can progress to late-stage syphilis, which can cause damage to internal organs, and lead to numbness, paralysis, blindness, or even death. Since syphilis may not present visible symptoms or may show up in hard-to-spot areas, it’s crucial to get tested regularly if you're sexually active. Testing is the only way to confirm the presence of syphilis.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>When to Get Tested</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It’s recommended to wait at least 3-6 weeks after potential exposure to syphilis to take the test, as this allows your immune system enough time to produce detectable antibodies. Additionally, if you’ve been treated for syphilis, you should get re-tested three months later to confirm that the infection has been cured.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>How the Test Is Done</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The test requires a blood sample, which is taken from a vein in your arm using a small needle. The procedure is quick and is done in a private setting by a trained technician. The sample is then analyzed for antibodies, and no fasting or special preparation is required beforehand.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Risks of the RPR Test</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The RPR test is minimally invasive and carries very few risks. However, since it involves drawing blood, some people may feel slight discomfort or a stinging sensation when the needle is inserted. The process of drawing blood can vary in difficulty depending on the size and condition of your veins. Afterward, some may experience bruising, soreness, or light-headedness.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Do RPR Results Mean?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our syphilis test is a qualitative RPR test, which provides a result indicating either negative (nonreactive) or positive (reactive) for syphilis infection.
      </p>

      <h3>Negative / Nonreactive Result</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        A negative result means that no antibodies typically produced during a syphilis infection have been detected. This suggests that you either don’t have syphilis or the test was conducted too early to detect antibodies. If you tested shortly after exposure, it’s possible the antibodies haven't had time to develop, which is known as a false-negative result. To get the most accurate results, it’s essential to wait for the recommended window period after exposure before getting tested.
      </p>

      <h3>Positive / Reactive Result</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        A positive result indicates that syphilis antibodies have been found, suggesting an active infection. However, to confirm the diagnosis, a positive result must be followed by a specific treponemal antibody test. This two-step process is necessary because the RPR test identifies antibodies that may also react to other conditions or infections. Therefore, additional tests are required to confirm syphilis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain conditions may cause a false positive, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IV drug use</li>
        <li>Lyme disease</li>
        <li>Pregnancy</li>
        <li>Tuberculosis (TB)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To confirm a positive result, a quantitative RPR test (titer) is performed to measure the antibody levels. Additionally, a Treponema Pallidum Antibodies (TPA) confirmatory test may be conducted to definitively diagnose syphilis.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>What Should You Do If You Test Positive for Syphilis?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        If both the RPR test and confirmatory tests indicate that you have syphilis, you should seek treatment. It's essential that your sexual partners are also tested and treated. Syphilis can be easily treated in its early stages with antibiotics, typically penicillin, administered via an injection. Depending on how far the infection has progressed, more than one shot may be necessary. Although our service does not provide injections, you can download or print your results and take them to a healthcare provider for proper treatment and follow-up care.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that everyone diagnosed with primary, secondary, latent, or tertiary syphilis should also be tested for HIV, as having syphilis increases the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV.
